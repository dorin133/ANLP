Question: Below are the graphs of two functions, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, defined on the domain $0\le x\le 18$:

[asy]
import graph; size(8cm); real lsf=0.5; pen dps=linewidth(0.7)+fontsize(10); defaultpen(dps); pen ds=black; real xmin=-1.5,xmax=18.5,ymin=-1.5,ymax=12.5;

pen cqcqcq=rgb(0.75,0.75,0.75);

/*grid*/ pen gs=linewidth(0.7)+cqcqcq+linetype("2 2"); real gx=1,gy=1;
for(real i=ceil(xmin/gx)*gx;i<=floor(xmax/gx)*gx;i+=gx) draw((i,ymin)--(i,ymax),gs); for(real i=ceil(ymin/gy)*gy;i<=floor(ymax/gy)*gy;i+=gy) draw((xmin,i)--(xmax,i),gs);

Label laxis; laxis.p=fontsize(10);

xaxis("",xmin,xmax,Ticks(laxis,Step=2.0,Size=2,NoZero),Arrows(6),above=true); yaxis("",ymin,ymax,Ticks(laxis,Step=2.0,Size=2,NoZero),Arrows(6),above=true);
draw((0,10)--(2,10)--(8,4)--(10,4)--(18,12),darkgreen+1.5);
draw((0,2)--(6,8)--(10,8)--(12,10)--(18,10),orange+dashed+1.5);
[/asy]

If the graph of $f(x)$ is the dashed orange line, and the graph of $g(x)$ is the solid green line, what is the largest value of $f(x)-g(x)$?
Full Solution: We can measure $|f(x)-g(x)|$ as the vertical distance between the two graphs at $x$. The sign of $f(x)-g(x)$ is positive if $f(x)>g(x)$, so we focus on the part of the graph where the dashed orange line lies above the solid dark green line. Within this part of the graph, the greatest vertical distance between the orange and green lines is $\boxed{4}$ (achieved for all $x$ from $8$ to $12$).

Question: What is the domain of the function $$k(y) = \frac{1}{2y+1}~?$$ Express your answer in interval notation.
Full Solution: The fraction $\frac{1}{2y+1}$ fails to be defined only if the denominator is zero. This occurs when $y$ is the solution of the equation $$2y+1=0,$$ which is $y=-\frac 12$. Thus the domain of $k(y)$ is $$\boxed{\left(-\infty,-\frac 12\right)\cup \left(-\frac 12,\infty\right)}.$$

Question: The ratio of two numbers is $3:5$. When 4 is subtracted from the lesser of the two numbers and 8 is added to the larger of the two, the new ratio is $2:7$. What is the greater of the two numbers before 8 is added to it?
Full Solution:

Let the two numbers be $3x$ and $5x$. According to the problem, when 4 is subtracted from the lesser number and 8 is added to the larger number, the new ratio is $2:7$. This gives us the equation:
\[
\frac{3x-4}{5x+8} = \frac{2}{7}
\]
To eliminate the fractions, we cross-multiply:
\[
7(3x-4) = 2(5x+8)
\]
Expanding both sides, we get:
\[
21x - 28 = 10x + 16
\]
Next, we isolate $x$ by subtracting $10x$ from both sides and adding 28 to both sides:
\[
11x = 44
\]
Solving for $x$, we divide both sides by 11:
\[
x = 4
\]
The greater of the two numbers before 8 is added to it is $5x$. Substituting $x = 4$, we get:
\[
5x = 5 \cdot 4 = 20
\]
Thus, the greater of the two numbers before 8 is added to it is \(\boxed{20}\).
