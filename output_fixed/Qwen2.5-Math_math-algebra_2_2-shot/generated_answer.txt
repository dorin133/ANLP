To determine the domain of the function \( k(y) = \frac{1}{2y+1} \), we need to identify the values of \( y \) for which the function is defined. The function is undefined when the denominator is zero because division by zero is not allowed. Therefore, we set the denominator equal to zero and solve for \( y \):

\[
2y + 1 = 0
\]

Subtract 1 from both sides:

\[
2y = -1
\]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[
y = -\frac{1}{2}
\]

This tells us that the function \( k(y) \) is undefined at \( y = -\frac{1}{2} \). Therefore, the domain of \( k(y) \) is all real numbers except \( y = -\frac{1}{2} \). In interval notation, this is written as:

\[
\boxed{(-\infty, -\frac{1}{2}) \cup (-\frac{1}{2}, \infty)}
\]
