Let's think step by step. Each thought should be separated by exactly two newline characters r'\n\n'.
Question: Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.

[asy] import olympiad;  unitsize(15);  pair A, B, C, D, E, F, P, O;  C = origin; A = (10,0); B = (7.8, 4.4899); draw(A--B--C--cycle); draw(A..B..C..cycle, red+dotted);  O = circumcenter(A, B, C);  E = rotate(90,B) * (O); F = rotate(90,C) * (O);  D = IP(B..E + (B-E)*4, C..F + (C-F)*-3);  draw(B--D--C--D--A);  P = IP(D..A, A..B..C);  dot(A); dot(B); dot(C); dot(D); dot(P); label("$A$", A, dir(335)); label("$B$", B, dir(65)); label("$C$", C, dir(200)); label("$D$", D, dir(135)); label("$P$", P, dir(235)); [/asy]
Full Solution: We have $\angle BCD = \angle CBD = \angle A$ from the tangency condition. With LoC we have $\cos(A) = \frac{25+100-81}{2*5*10} = \frac{11}{25}$ and $\cos(B) = \frac{81+25-100}{2*9*5} = \frac{1}{15}$. Then, $CD = \frac{\frac{9}{2}}{\cos(A)} = \frac{225}{22}$. Using LoC we can find $AD$: $AD^2 = AC^2 + CD^2 - 2(AC)(CD)\cos(A+C) = 10^2+(\frac{225}{22})^2 + 2(10)\frac{225}{22}\cos(B) = 100 + \frac{225^2}{22^2} + 2(10)\frac{225}{22}*\frac{1}{15} = \frac{5^4*13^2}{484}$. Thus, $AD = \frac{5^2*13}{22}$. By Power of a Point, $DP*AD = CD^2$ so $DP*\frac{5^2*13}{22} = (\frac{225}{22})^2$ which gives $DP = \frac{5^2*9^2}{13*22}$. Finally, we have $AP = AD - DP = \frac{5^2*13}{22} - \frac{5^2*9^2}{13*22} = \frac{100}{13}$. So the answer is $\boxed{113}$.

Question: Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be points on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.
Full Solution: Assume that $AC$ is the asymptote of the hyperbola, in which case $BD$ is minimized. The expression of $BD$ is $y=-\sqrt{\frac{5}{6}}x$. Thus, we could get $\frac{x^2}{20}-\frac{y^2}{24}=1\implies x^2=\frac{720}{11}$. The desired value is $4\cdot \frac{11}{6}x^2=480$. This case can't be achieved, so all $BD^2$ would be greater than $\boxed{480}$.

Question: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.
Full Solution:

To solve the problem, we will use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let's define the following sets:
- \( D \) is the set of residents who own a diamond ring.
- \( G \) is the set of residents who own a set of golf clubs.
- \( S \) is the set of residents who own a garden spade.
- \( C \) is the set of residents who own a bag of candy hearts.

We are given the following information:
- \( |D| = 195 \)
- \( |G| = 367 \)
- \( |S| = 562 \)
- \( |C| = 900 \)
- The number of residents who own exactly two of these things is 437.
- The number of residents who own exactly three of these things is 234.

We need to find the number of residents who own all four of these things, denoted as \( |D \cap G \cap S \cap C| \).

First, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion for four sets:
\[
|D \cup G \cup S \cup C| = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| - |D \cap G| - |D \cap S| - |D \cap C| - |G \cap S| - |G \cap C| - |S \cap C| + |D \cap G \cap S| + |D \cap G \cap C| + |D \cap S \cap C| + |G \cap S \cap C| - |D \cap G \cap S \cap C|
\]

We know that the total number of residents is 900:
\[
|D \cup G \cup S \cup C| = 900
\]

Next, we need to express the sums of the intersections in terms of the given information. Let:
- \( x_2 \) be the number of residents who own exactly two items.
- \( x_3 \) be the number of residents who own exactly three items.
- \( x_4 \) be the number of residents who own all four items.

From the problem, we have:
\[
x_2 = 437 \quad \text{and} \quad x_3 = 234
\]

The total number of residents can also be expressed as:
\[
|D \cup G \cup S \cup C| = \sum_{i=1}^{4} x_i
\]

However, this sum counts each resident who owns exactly two items twice, each resident who owns exactly three items three times, and each resident who owns all four items four times. Therefore, we need to adjust for these overcounts:
\[
|D \cup G \cup S \cup C| = x_1 + 2x_2 + 3x_3 + 4x_4
\]

Since \( x_1 = 0 \) (no resident owns exactly one item), we have:
\[
900 = 2x_2 + 3x_3 + 4x_4
\]

Substituting the given values:
\[
900 = 2(437) + 3(234) + 4x_4
\]

Calculate the terms:
\[
2(437) = 874
\]
\[
3(234) = 702
\]

Add these values:
\[
874 + 702 = 1576
\]

Substitute back into the equation:
\[
900 = 1576 + 4x_4
\]

Solve for \( x_4 \):
\[
4x_4 = 900 - 1576
\]
\[
4x_4 = -676
\]
\[
x_4 = -676 + 1576
