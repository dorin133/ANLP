Let's think step by step. Each thought should be separated by exactly two newline characters r'\n\n'.
Question: Suppose that $f$ is a function and $f^{-1}$ is the inverse of $f$.  If $f(1)=2$, $f(2) = 6$, and $f(3)=5$, then what is $f^{-1}(f^{-1}(6))$?
Full Solution: Since $f(2) = 6$, we have $f^{-1}(6)=2$. (Note that the hypothesis that $f$ has an inverse implies that there are no other values of $x$ with $f(x) = 6$.)  Similarly, $f(1) =2$ implies $f^{-1}(2)=1$.   So $f^{-1}(f^{-1}(6))=f^{-1}(2)=\boxed{1}$.

Question: The points $(x, y)$ represented in this table lie on a straight line. The point $(13, q)$ lies on the same line. What is the value of $p + q?$ Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth. $$\begin{array}{c|c}
x & y \\ \hline
2 & -5 \\
p & -14 \\
p+2 & -17 \\
\end{array}$$
Full Solution: If we have two points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ on a line, we can find the slope of the line by using the formula $\dfrac{y_1-y_2}{x_1-x_2}.$ So, for the line we are given, the slope is $\dfrac{(-5)-(-14)}{2-p}=\dfrac{9}{2-p},$ and the slope is also $\dfrac{(-14)-(-17)}{p-(p+2)}=\dfrac{3}{-2}.$ Setting these values equal, we get $$\dfrac{9}{2-p}=-\dfrac{3}{2}.$$ Multiplying both sides by the product of the denominators and simplifying gives \begin{align*}
(2-p)(3)&=(-2)(9)\\
6-3p&=-18 \\
p&=8.
\end{align*} Now we need to find $q.$ Using the same strategy as above, we find that \begin{align*}
\frac{q-(-5)}{13-2}&=\frac{3}{-2} \\
(11)(3)&=(-2)(q+5)\\
33&=-2q-10 \\
q&=-21.5.\\
\end{align*} Therefore, $p+q=8+(-21.5)=\boxed{-13.5}.$

Question: Find all positive integer values of $c$ such that the equation $x^2-7x+c=0$ only has roots that are real and rational. Express them in decreasing order, separated by commas.

To determine the positive integer values of \( c \) such that the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 7x + c = 0 \) has real and rational roots, we need to ensure that the discriminant of the quadratic equation is a perfect square. The general form of a quadratic equation is \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), and its discriminant is given by \( \Delta = b^2 - 4ac \). For the equation \( x^2 - 7x + c = 0 \), we have \( a = 1 \), \( b = -7 \), and \( c = c \). Therefore, the discriminant is:

\[
\Delta = (-7)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot c = 49 - 4c
\]

For the roots to be real and rational, \( \Delta \) must be a non-negative perfect square. Let's denote this perfect square by \( k^2 \), where \( k \) is an integer. Then we have:

\[
49 - 4c = k^2
\]

Rearranging this equation to solve for \( c \), we get:

\[
4c = 49 - k^2 \implies c = \frac{49 - k^2}{4}
\]

Since \( c \) is a positive integer, \( 49 - k^2 \) must be a positive multiple of 4. We need to find all integers \( k \) such that \( 49 - k^2 > 0 \) and \( 49 - k^2 \) is divisible by 4. The inequality \( 49 - k^2 > 0 \) implies \( k^2 < 49 \), so \( -7 < k < 7 \). The possible integer values for \( k \) are \( -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \). We now check which of these values make \( 49 - k^2 \) divisible by 4:

- For \( k = -6 \) or \( k = 6 \), \( 49 - (-6)^2 = 49 - 36 = 13 \) (not divisible by 4)
- For \( k = -5 \) or \( k = 5 \), \( 49 - (-5)^2 = 49 - 25 = 24 \) (divisible by 4)
- For \( k = -4 \) or \( k = 4 \), \( 49 - (-4)^2 = 49 - 16 = 33 \) (not divisible by 4)
- For \( k = -3 \) or \( k = 3 \), \( 49 - (-3)^2 = 49 - 9 = 40 \) (divisible by 4)
- For \( k = -2 \) or \( k = 2 \), \( 49 - (-2)^2 = 49 - 4 = 45 \) (not divisible by 4)
- For \( k = -1 \) or \( k = 1 \), \( 49 - (-1)^2 = 49 - 1 = 48 \) (divisible by 4)
- For \( k = 0 \), \( 49 - 0^2 = 49 \) (not divisible by 4)

The values of \( k \) that work are \( -5, 5, -3, 3, -1, 1 \). We now calculate \( c \) for each of these values:

- For \( k = -5 \) or \( k = 5 \), \( c = \frac{49 - 25}{4} = \frac{24}{4} = 6 \)
- For \( k = -3 \) or \( k = 3 \), \( c = \frac{49 - 9}{4} = \frac{40}{4} = 10 \)
- For \( k = -1 \) or \( k = 1 \), \( c = \frac{49 - 1}{4} = \frac{48}{4} = 12 \)

Therefore, the positive integer values of \( c \) are \( 12, 10, 6 \). In decreasing order, they are:

\[
\boxed{12, 10, 6}
\]
