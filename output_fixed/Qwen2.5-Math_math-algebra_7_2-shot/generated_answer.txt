To determine the positive integer values of \( c \) such that the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 7x + c = 0 \) has real and rational roots, we need to ensure that the discriminant of the quadratic equation is a perfect square. The general form of a quadratic equation is \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), and its discriminant is given by \( \Delta = b^2 - 4ac \). For the equation \( x^2 - 7x + c = 0 \), we have \( a = 1 \), \( b = -7 \), and \( c = c \). Therefore, the discriminant is:

\[
\Delta = (-7)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot c = 49 - 4c
\]

For the roots to be real and rational, \( \Delta \) must be a non-negative perfect square. Let's denote this perfect square by \( k^2 \), where \( k \) is an integer. Then we have:

\[
49 - 4c = k^2
\]

Rearranging this equation to solve for \( c \), we get:

\[
4c = 49 - k^2 \implies c = \frac{49 - k^2}{4}
\]

Since \( c \) is a positive integer, \( 49 - k^2 \) must be a positive multiple of 4. We need to find all integers \( k \) such that \( 49 - k^2 > 0 \) and \( 49 - k^2 \) is divisible by 4. The inequality \( 49 - k^2 > 0 \) implies \( k^2 < 49 \), so \( -7 < k < 7 \). The possible integer values for \( k \) are \( -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \). We now check which of these values make \( 49 - k^2 \) divisible by 4:

- For \( k = -6 \) or \( k = 6 \), \( 49 - (-6)^2 = 49 - 36 = 13 \) (not divisible by 4)
- For \( k = -5 \) or \( k = 5 \), \( 49 - (-5)^2 = 49 - 25 = 24 \) (divisible by 4)
- For \( k = -4 \) or \( k = 4 \), \( 49 - (-4)^2 = 49 - 16 = 33 \) (not divisible by 4)
- For \( k = -3 \) or \( k = 3 \), \( 49 - (-3)^2 = 49 - 9 = 40 \) (divisible by 4)
- For \( k = -2 \) or \( k = 2 \), \( 49 - (-2)^2 = 49 - 4 = 45 \) (not divisible by 4)
- For \( k = -1 \) or \( k = 1 \), \( 49 - (-1)^2 = 49 - 1 = 48 \) (divisible by 4)
- For \( k = 0 \), \( 49 - 0^2 = 49 \) (not divisible by 4)

The values of \( k \) that work are \( -5, 5, -3, 3, -1, 1 \). We now calculate \( c \) for each of these values:

- For \( k = -5 \) or \( k = 5 \), \( c = \frac{49 - 25}{4} = \frac{24}{4} = 6 \)
- For \( k = -3 \) or \( k = 3 \), \( c = \frac{49 - 9}{4} = \frac{40}{4} = 10 \)
- For \( k = -1 \) or \( k = 1 \), \( c = \frac{49 - 1}{4} = \frac{48}{4} = 12 \)

Therefore, the positive integer values of \( c \) are \( 12, 10, 6 \). In decreasing order, they are:

\[
\boxed{12, 10, 6}
\]
