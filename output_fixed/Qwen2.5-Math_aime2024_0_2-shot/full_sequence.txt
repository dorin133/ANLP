Let's think step by step. Each thought should be separated by exactly two newline characters r'\n\n'.
Question: Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be points on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.
Full Solution: Assume that $AC$ is the asymptote of the hyperbola, in which case $BD$ is minimized. The expression of $BD$ is $y=-\sqrt{\frac{5}{6}}x$. Thus, we could get $\frac{x^2}{20}-\frac{y^2}{24}=1\implies x^2=\frac{720}{11}$. The desired value is $4\cdot \frac{11}{6}x^2=480$. This case can't be achieved, so all $BD^2$ would be greater than $\boxed{480}$.

Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\rac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.
Full Solution: This question looks complex, but once converted into a number theory problem, it becomes elementary. We know, if the dimensions are taken to be numbers in the form of coprime numbers $p/q$, $q/r$, and $r$, it is immediately obvious that $p=23$. Solving, we get: \[23(r^2+q)/qr + q = 27\]. We know length cannot be negative, therefore, $q=4$. Again, we see: \[23/r + 4 + 23r/4 = 27\] giving rise to $r=2$. For a cuboid inside a circle, we know: the radius is half its diagonal, or equivalently, \[r^2 = (L^2 + b^2 + h^2)/4\]. Here, \[r^2 = (128 + 529)/64\], so we get $p+q = 657 + 64 = 721$.

Question: Let $\omega \neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when 
\[ \prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) \] is divided by 1000.

To find the remainder when \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})\) is divided by 1000, where \(\omega\) is a primitive 13th root of unity, we start by noting that \(\omega^{13} = 1\) and the polynomial \(x^{13} - 1 = 0\) has roots \(\omega^0, \omega^1, \omega^2, \ldots, \omega^{12}\). We can factorize this polynomial as:
\[x^{13} - 1 = (x-1)(x-\omega)(x-\omega^2)\cdots(x-\omega^{12}).\]
We are interested in the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})\). To simplify this, we consider the polynomial \(P(x) = x^{13} - 1\) and substitute \(x = 2 - x\). This gives:
\[P(2 - x) = (2 - x)^{13} - 1.\]
We need to evaluate \(P(2 - \omega^k)\) for \(k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 12\). Notice that:
\[P(2 - \omega^k) = (2 - \omega^k)^{13} - 1.\]
Since \(\omega^k\) is a root of \(x^{13} - 1 = 0\), we have:
\[(2 - \omega^k)^{13} = 2^{13} - 13 \cdot 2^{12} \omega^k + \binom{13}{2} 2^{11} (\omega^k)^2 - \cdots + (\omega^k)^{13}.\]
However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the polynomial \(P(x)\) can be rewritten in terms of its roots:
\[P(x) = (x-1)(x-\omega)(x-\omega^2)\cdots(x-\omega^{12}).\]
By substituting \(x = 2 - x\) into the polynomial, we get:
\[P(2 - x) = (2 - x - 1)(2 - x - \omega)(2 - x - \omega^2)\cdots(2 - x - \omega^{12}) = (1 - x)(1 - (2 - \omega))(1 - (2 - \omega^2))\cdots(1 - (2 - \omega^{12})).\]
This simplifies to:
\[P(2 - x) = (1 - x)(\omega - 1)(\omega^2 - 1)\cdots(\omega^{12} - 1).\]
Therefore, we have:
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) = P(2 - \omega^0) = P(1) = 1^{13} - 1 = 0.\]
However, this is not the correct approach. Instead, we need to consider the polynomial \(Q(x) = x^{13} - 1\) and its derivative \(Q'(x) = 13x^{12}\). The value of the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})\) is given by:
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) = 13^2 = 169.\]
Therefore, the remainder when \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})\) is divided by 1000 is:
\[\boxed{169}.\]
