To determine the value of \( p + q \), we first need to find the equation of the straight line that passes through the given points. The points given are \((2, -5)\), \((p, -14)\), and \((p+2, -17)\).

First, we calculate the slope \( m \) of the line using the points \((2, -5)\) and \((p+2, -17)\):
\[
m = \frac{-17 - (-5)}{(p+2) - 2} = \frac{-17 + 5}{p} = \frac{-12}{p}
\]

Next, we use the point-slope form of the equation of a line, \( y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \), with the point \((2, -5)\) and the slope \( m = \frac{-12}{p} \):
\[
y + 5 = \frac{-12}{p}(x - 2)
\]

We can simplify this equation to the slope-intercept form \( y = mx + b \):
\[
y + 5 = \frac{-12}{p}x + \frac{24}{p}
\]
\[
y = \frac{-12}{p}x + \frac{24}{p} - 5
\]

Now, we substitute the point \((p, -14)\) into the equation to find \( p \):
\[
-14 = \frac{-12}{p}p + \frac{24}{p} - 5
\]
\[
-14 = -12 + \frac{24}{p} - 5
\]
\[
-14 = -17 + \frac{24}{p}
\]
\[
3 = \frac{24}{p}
\]
\[
p = \frac{24}{3} = 8
\]

Now that we have \( p = 8 \), we substitute \( p = 8 \) back into the equation of the line to find \( q \). The point \((13, q)\) lies on the line, so we substitute \( x = 13 \) into the equation:
\[
y = \frac{-12}{8}x + \frac{24}{8} - 5
\]
\[
y = -\frac{3}{2}x + 3 - 5
\]
\[
y = -\frac{3}{2}x - 2
\]
\[
q = -\frac{3}{2}(13) - 2
\]
\[
q = -\frac{39}{2} - 2
\]
\[
q = -\frac{39}{2} - \frac{4}{2}
\]
\[
q = -\frac{43}{2} = -21.5
\]

Finally, we find \( p + q \):
\[
p + q = 8 + (-21.5) = 8 - 21.5 = -13.5
\]

Thus, the value of \( p + q \) is \(\boxed{-13.5}\).
