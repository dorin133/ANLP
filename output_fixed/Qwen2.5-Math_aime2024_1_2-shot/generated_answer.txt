To find the radius \( r \) of the smallest sphere that can contain each rectangular box with surface area 54 and volume 23, we start by letting the dimensions of the box be \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \). The surface area and volume of the box are given by the equations:
\[
2(ab + bc + ca) = 54 \quad \text{and} \quad abc = 23.
\]
We need to find the radius \( r \) of the sphere that circumscribes the box, which is given by:
\[
r = \frac{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}}{2}.
\]
First, we express \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \) in terms of \( ab + bc + ca \) and \( abc \). Using the identity:
\[
(a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca),
\]
we can solve for \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \):
\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca).
\]
From the surface area equation, we know:
\[
ab + bc + ca = 27.
\]
Thus,
\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (a + b + c)^2 - 2 \cdot 27 = (a + b + c)^2 - 54.
\]
To minimize \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \), we need to find the minimum value of \( a + b + c \). Using the AM-GM inequality, we have:
\[
a + b + c \geq 3\sqrt[3]{abc} = 3\sqrt[3]{23}.
\]
However, we need to check if this minimum value is achievable. Let's assume \( a = b = c \). Then:
\[
3a^2 = 27 \implies a^2 = 9 \implies a = 3.
\]
Substituting \( a = b = c = 3 \) into the volume equation, we get:
\[
abc = 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 = 27,
\]
which is not equal to 23. Therefore, \( a = b = c \) is not a solution. Instead, we need to find the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) that satisfy both the surface area and volume equations and minimize \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \).

We use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Define the function:
\[
f(a, b, c) = a^2 + b^2 + c^2,
\]
and the constraints:
\[
g(a, b, c) = 2(ab + bc + ca) - 54 = 0,
\]
\[
h(a, b, c) = abc - 23 = 0.
\]
The gradients of \( f \), \( g \), and \( h \) are:
\[
\nabla f = (2a, 2b, 2c),
\]
\[
\nabla g = (2(b+c), 2(a+c), 2(a+b)),
\]
\[
\nabla h = (bc, ac, ab).
\]
Setting \(\nabla f = \lambda \nabla g + \mu \nabla h\), we get the system of equations:
\[
2a = \lambda \cdot 2(b+c) + \mu bc,
\]
\[
2b = \lambda \cdot 2(a+c) + \mu ac,
\]
\[
2c = \lambda \cdot 2(a+b) + \mu ab,
\]
\[
2(ab + bc + ca) = 54,
\]
\[
abc = 23.
\]
Simplifying the first three equations, we have:
\[
a = \lambda(b+c) + \frac{\mu bc}{2},
\]
\[
b = \lambda(a+c) + \frac{\mu ac}{2},
\]
\[
c = \lambda(a+b) + \frac{\mu ab}{2}.
\]
Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get:
\[
a - b = \lambda(b+c - a - c) + \frac{\mu bc - \mu ac}{2} \implies a - b = -\lambda(a - b) + \frac{\mu c(b - a)}{2} \implies (a - b)(1 + \lambda + \frac{\mu c}{2}) = 0.
\]
This implies either \( a = b \) or \( 1 + \lambda + \frac{\mu c}{2} = 0 \). Similarly, we can show that either \( b = c \) or \( 1 + \lambda + \frac{\mu a}{2} = 0 \), and either \( c = a \) or \( 1 + \lambda + \frac{\mu b}{2} = 0 \). Therefore, at least two of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) must be equal.

Assume \( a = b \). Then the equations become:
\[
2a^2 + 2ac = 27 \implies a^2 + ac = \frac{27}{2},
