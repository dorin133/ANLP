To find \( f^{-1}(f^{-1}(6)) \), we need to determine the value of \( f^{-1}(6) \) first. The inverse function \( f^{-1} \) is defined such that if \( f(a) = b \), then \( f^{-1}(b) = a \).

Given:
- \( f(1) = 2 \)
- \( f(2) = 6 \)
- \( f(3) = 5 \)

From \( f(2) = 6 \), we can find \( f^{-1}(6) \):
\[ f^{-1}(6) = 2 \]

Next, we need to find \( f^{-1}(f^{-1}(6)) \), which is \( f^{-1}(2) \):
- From \( f(1) = 2 \), we have \( f^{-1}(2) = 1 \)

Therefore, \( f^{-1}(f^{-1}(6)) = 1 \).

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{1}
\]
