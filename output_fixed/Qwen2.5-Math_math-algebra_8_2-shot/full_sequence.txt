Let's think step by step. Each thought should be separated by exactly two newline characters r'\n\n'.
Question: What is the domain of the function $$k(y) = \frac{1}{2y+1}~?$$ Express your answer in interval notation.
Full Solution: The fraction $\frac{1}{2y+1}$ fails to be defined only if the denominator is zero. This occurs when $y$ is the solution of the equation $$2y+1=0,$$ which is $y=-\frac 12$. Thus the domain of $k(y)$ is $$\boxed{\left(-\infty,-\frac 12\right)\cup \left(-\frac 12,\infty\right)}.$$

Question: Simplify $(3-i)(6+2i)$.
Full Solution: $(3-i)(6+2i) = 3(6) + 3(2i) -i(6) -i(2i) = 18+6i-6i +2 = \boxed{20}$.

Question: Suppose that $f$ is a function and $f^{-1}$ is the inverse of $f$.  If $f(1)=2$, $f(2) = 6$, and $f(3)=5$, then what is $f^{-1}(f^{-1}(6))$?

To find \( f^{-1}(f^{-1}(6)) \), we need to determine the value of \( f^{-1}(6) \) first. The inverse function \( f^{-1} \) is defined such that if \( f(a) = b \), then \( f^{-1}(b) = a \).

Given:
- \( f(1) = 2 \)
- \( f(2) = 6 \)
- \( f(3) = 5 \)

From \( f(2) = 6 \), we can find \( f^{-1}(6) \):
\[ f^{-1}(6) = 2 \]

Next, we need to find \( f^{-1}(f^{-1}(6)) \), which is \( f^{-1}(2) \):
- From \( f(1) = 2 \), we have \( f^{-1}(2) = 1 \)

Therefore, \( f^{-1}(f^{-1}(6)) = 1 \).

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{1}
\]
