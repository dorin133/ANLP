Let's think step by step. Each thought should be separated by exactly two newline characters r'\n\n'.
Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the inside of $S$, it is internally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $	frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.
Full Solution: First, let's consider a section $\mathcal{P}$ of the solids, along the axis. By some 3D-Geometry thinking, we can simply know that the axis crosses the sphere center. So, that is saying, the $\mathcal{P}$ we took crosses one of the equator of the sphere.

Here I drew two graphs, the first one is the case when $T$ is internally tangent to $S$, and the second one is when $T$ is externally tangent to $S$.

In both cases, we know $\Delta OEF \sim \Delta OGH \Longrightarrow \frac{EF}{OE} =\frac{GH}{OG}$.

Hence, in the case of internal tangent, $\frac{6}{11-3} =\frac{r_i}{11} \Longrightarrow r_i=\frac{33}{4}$.

In the case of external tangent, $\frac{6}{11+3} =\frac{r_o}{11} \Longrightarrow r_o=\frac{33}{7}$.

Thereby, $r_i-r_o=\frac{33}{4}-\frac{33}{7}=\frac{99}{28}$. And there goes the answer, $99+28=\boxed{127}$.

Question: Let ABCDEF be a convex equilateral hexagon in which all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Find the side length of the hexagon.
Full Solution: Draw an accurate diagram using the allowed compass and ruler: Draw a to-scale diagram of the $(200,240,300)$ triangle (e.g. 10cm-12cm-15cm). Because of the nature of these lengths and the integer answer needed, it can be assumed that the side length of the hexagon will be divisible by 10. Therefore, a trial-and-error method can be set up, wherein line segments of length $n\cdot 10$, scaled to the same scale as the triangle, can be drawn to represent the sides of the hexagon. For instance, side $BC$ would be drawn parallel to the side of the triangle of length 300, and would have endpoints on the other sides of the triangle. Using this method, it would be evident that line segments of length 80 units, scaled proportionally (4cm using the scale above), would create a perfect equilateral hexagon when drawn parallel to the sides of the triangle. $x=\boxed{080}$.

Question: Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers $(a,b,c)$ satisfying $a + b + c = 300$ and \[a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.\]

To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given equations:
\[a + b + c = 300\]
\[a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.\]

First, we rewrite the second equation using the identity:
\[a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca) - 3abc.\]
Substituting \(a + b + c = 300\) into the equation, we get:
\[6,000,000 = 300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.\]
Dividing both sides by 3, we obtain:
\[2,000,000 = 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc.\]
Rearranging the terms, we have:
\[abc = 100(ab + bc + ca) - 2,000,000.\]

Next, we consider the possible values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). Since \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are nonnegative integers and their sum is 300, we can start by checking if any of them are zero. If \(a = 0\), then the equation simplifies to:
\[b + c = 300\]
\[0 = 100bc,\]
which implies \(b = 0\) or \(c = 0\). Therefore, the solutions are \((0, 0, 300)\), \((0, 300, 0)\), and \((300, 0, 0)\). This gives us 3 solutions.

Now, we assume that \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are all positive. We can use the AM-GM inequality to get some insight into the possible values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). By the AM-GM inequality, we have:
\[\frac{a+b+c}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{abc} \implies 100 \geq \sqrt[3]{abc} \implies abc \leq 100^3 = 1,000,000.\]
From the equation \(abc = 100(ab + bc + ca) - 2,000,000\), we know that \(abc\) must be greater than or equal to 2,000,000. Therefore, we have:
\[2,000,000 \leq abc \leq 1,000,000,\]
which is a contradiction. This means that \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) cannot all be positive.

Thus, the only solutions are \((0, 0, 300)\), \((0, 300, 0)\), and \((300, 0, 0)\). Therefore, the number of triples \((a, b, c)\) that satisfy the given equations is:
\[\boxed{3}.\]
