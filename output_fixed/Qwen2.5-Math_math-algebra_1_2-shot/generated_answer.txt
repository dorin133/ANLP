To determine how many dollars Mike will be offered in 12 more years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the initial price of the stamp three years ago.
2. Determine the price of the stamp now.
3. Calculate the price of the stamp in 12 more years, given that the price doubles every three years.

First, we know that three years ago, Mike paid \$1.25 for the stamp. Therefore, the current price of the stamp is double the price he paid three years ago:
\[
2 \times 1.25 = 2.50 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many times the price will double in the next 12 years. Since the price doubles every three years, we divide 12 by 3:
\[
12 \div 3 = 4
\]
This means the price will double 4 times in the next 12 years. To find the price after 12 years, we multiply the current price by 2 four times:
\[
2.50 \times 2^4 = 2.50 \times 16 = 40 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the amount Mike will be offered in 12 more years is \(\boxed{40}\).
