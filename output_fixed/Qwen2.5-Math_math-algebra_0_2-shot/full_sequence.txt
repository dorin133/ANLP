Let's think step by step. Each thought should be separated by exactly two newline characters r'\n\n'.
Question: The ratio of two numbers is $3:5$. When 4 is subtracted from the lesser of the two numbers and 8 is added to the larger of the two, the new ratio is $2:7$. What is the greater of the two numbers before 8 is added to it?
Full Solution: Let $a$ be the smaller of the two numbers and let $b$ be the larger of the two. Then $\dfrac{a}{b}=\dfrac{3}{5}$, so $5a=3b$. Additionally, $\dfrac{a-4}{b+8}=\dfrac{2}{7}$, so cross multiplying gives $7(a-4)=2(b+8)$. We now have a system of two linear equations; solving gives $a=12$, $b=20$. Since the question asks us for the value of $b$, our answer is $\boxed{20}$.

Question: What is the domain of the function $$k(y) = \frac{1}{2y+1}~?$$ Express your answer in interval notation.
Full Solution: The fraction $\frac{1}{2y+1}$ fails to be defined only if the denominator is zero. This occurs when $y$ is the solution of the equation $$2y+1=0,$$ which is $y=-\frac 12$. Thus the domain of $k(y)$ is $$\boxed{\left(-\infty,-\frac 12\right)\cup \left(-\frac 12,\infty\right)}.$$

To simplify the expression \((3-i)(6+2i)\), we use the distributive property (also known as the FOIL method for binomials). This means we multiply each term in the first binomial by each term in the second binomial.

Starting with \((3-i)(6+2i)\), we distribute as follows:
\[
(3-i)(6+2i) = 3 \cdot 6 + 3 \cdot 2i - i \cdot 6 - i \cdot 2i
\]

Next, we perform the multiplications:
\[
3 \cdot 6 = 18
\]
\[
3 \cdot 2i = 6i
\]
\[
-i \cdot 6 = -6i
\]
\[
-i \cdot 2i = -2i^2
\]

Now, we combine these results:
\[
18 + 6i - 6i - 2i^2
\]

The terms \(6i\) and \(-6i\) cancel each other out, so we are left with:
\[
18 - 2i^2
\]

We know that \(i^2 = -1\), so we substitute \(-1\) for \(i^2\):
\[
18 - 2(-1) = 18 + 2 = 20
\]

Therefore, the simplified form of \((3-i)(6+2i)\) is:
\[
\boxed{20}
\]
