To simplify the expression \((3-i)(6+2i)\), we use the distributive property (also known as the FOIL method for binomials). This means we multiply each term in the first binomial by each term in the second binomial.

Starting with \((3-i)(6+2i)\), we distribute as follows:
\[
(3-i)(6+2i) = 3 \cdot 6 + 3 \cdot 2i - i \cdot 6 - i \cdot 2i
\]

Next, we perform the multiplications:
\[
3 \cdot 6 = 18
\]
\[
3 \cdot 2i = 6i
\]
\[
-i \cdot 6 = -6i
\]
\[
-i \cdot 2i = -2i^2
\]

Now, we combine these results:
\[
18 + 6i - 6i - 2i^2
\]

The terms \(6i\) and \(-6i\) cancel each other out, so we are left with:
\[
18 - 2i^2
\]

We know that \(i^2 = -1\), so we substitute \(-1\) for \(i^2\):
\[
18 - 2(-1) = 18 + 2 = 20
\]

Therefore, the simplified form of \((3-i)(6+2i)\) is:
\[
\boxed{20}
\]
