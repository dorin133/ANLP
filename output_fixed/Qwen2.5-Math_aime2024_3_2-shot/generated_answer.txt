To solve for \(AP\) in the given triangle \(ABC\) inscribed in circle \(\omega\), we start by using the properties of the tangents and the power of a point.

First, we note that \(D\) is the intersection of the tangents to \(\omega\) at \(B\) and \(C\). By the power of a point theorem, the power of point \(D\) with respect to \(\omega\) is equal to \(DB^2 = DC^2\). Since \(D\) is the intersection of the tangents, \(DB\) and \(DC\) are equal to the length of the tangent from \(D\) to \(\omega\).

Next, we use the fact that \(AD\) is a symmedian of \(\triangle ABC\). The symmedian divides the opposite side in the ratio of the squares of the other two sides. Therefore, we have:
\[
\frac{BP}{PC} = \left(\frac{AB}{AC}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{5}{10}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Let \(BP = x\) and \(PC = 4x\). Since \(P\) lies on \(AD\), we can use the power of a point theorem again to find \(AP\). The power of point \(A\) with respect to \(\omega\) is:
\[
AP \cdot AD = AB \cdot AC = 5 \cdot 10 = 50
\]

To find \(AD\), we use the formula for the length of the symmedian:
\[
AD^2 = AB \cdot AC \left(1 - \frac{BC^2}{(AB+AC)^2}\right)
\]

Substituting the given values:
\[
AD^2 = 5 \cdot 10 \left(1 - \frac{9^2}{(5+10)^2}\right) = 50 \left(1 - \frac{81}{225}\right) = 50 \left(1 - \frac{9}{25}\right) = 50 \left(\frac{16}{25}\right) = 32
\]

Thus, \(AD = \sqrt{32} = 4\sqrt{2}\).

Now, we substitute \(AD = 4\sqrt{2}\) into the power of a point equation:
\[
AP \cdot 4\sqrt{2} = 50
\]

Solving for \(AP\):
\[
AP = \frac{50}{4\sqrt{2}} = \frac{25}{2\sqrt{2}} = \frac{25\sqrt{2}}{4}
\]

Therefore, \(AP\) can be written as \(\frac{m}{n}\) where \(m = 25\sqrt{2}\) and \(n = 4\). Since \(m\) and \(n\) are relatively prime integers, we need to rationalize \(m\). However, since \(m\) is already in its simplest form, we find \(m = 25\sqrt{2}\) and \(n = 4\).

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{601}
\]
