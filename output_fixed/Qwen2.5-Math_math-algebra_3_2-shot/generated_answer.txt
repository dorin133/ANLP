To solve the problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's define the variables:
- \( T \) represents the weight of one treek.
- \( S \) represents the weight of one squig.
- \( G \) represents the weight of one goolee.

From the problem, we have the following two equations:
1. Ten treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee:
   \[
   10T = 3S + G
   \]
2. Two treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig:
   \[
   2T + G = S
   \]

We need to find the combined weight of how many treeks equals the weight of one squig. To do this, we will solve the system of equations for \( S \) in terms of \( T \).

First, let's isolate \( G \) in the second equation:
\[
G = S - 2T
\]

Next, substitute \( G = S - 2T \) into the first equation:
\[
10T = 3S + (S - 2T)
\]

Simplify the right-hand side:
\[
10T = 3S + S - 2T
\]
\[
10T = 4S - 2T
\]

Add \( 2T \) to both sides to combine the \( T \) terms:
\[
12T = 4S
\]

Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( S \):
\[
S = 3T
\]

This tells us that one squig weighs as much as three treeks. Therefore, the combined weight of three treeks equals the weight of one squig.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]
