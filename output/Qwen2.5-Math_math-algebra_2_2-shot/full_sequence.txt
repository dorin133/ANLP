Question: Ten treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee. Two treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig. The combined weight of how many treeks equals the weight of one squig?
Full Solution: Let $t,s,g$ be the weight of one treek, the weight of one squig, and the weight of one goolee, respectively. Then the given information tells us \begin{align*}
10t &=3s+g\\
2t +g &= s.
\end{align*} Since we would like to solve for $s$ in terms of $t$, we want to eliminate $g$. Add the two equations to obtain \begin{align*}
10t+2t+g &= 3s+g+s\\
\Rightarrow 10t+2t &= 3s+s\\
\Rightarrow 4s &= 12t\\
\Rightarrow s &=3t.
\end{align*} So one squig weighs $\boxed{3}$ treeks.

Question: The points $(x, y)$ represented in this table lie on a straight line. The point $(13, q)$ lies on the same line. What is the value of $p + q?$ Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth. $$\begin{array}{c|c}
x & y \\ \hline
2 & -5 \\
p & -14 \\
p+2 & -17 \\
\end{array}$$
Full Solution: If we have two points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ on a line, we can find the slope of the line by using the formula $\dfrac{y_1-y_2}{x_1-x_2}.$ So, for the line we are given, the slope is $\dfrac{(-5)-(-14)}{2-p}=\dfrac{9}{2-p},$ and the slope is also $\dfrac{(-14)-(-17)}{p-(p+2)}=\dfrac{3}{-2}.$ Setting these values equal, we get $$\dfrac{9}{2-p}=-\dfrac{3}{2}.$$ Multiplying both sides by the product of the denominators and simplifying gives \begin{align*}
(2-p)(3)&=(-2)(9)\\
6-3p&=-18 \\
p&=8.
\end{align*} Now we need to find $q.$ Using the same strategy as above, we find that \begin{align*}
\frac{q-(-5)}{13-2}&=\frac{3}{-2} \\
(11)(3)&=(-2)(q+5)\\
33&=-2q-10 \\
q&=-21.5.\\
\end{align*} Therefore, $p+q=8+(-21.5)=\boxed{-13.5}.$

Question: What is the domain of the function $$k(y) = \frac{1}{2y+1}~?$$ Express your answer in interval notation.

To determine the domain of the function \( k(y) = \frac{1}{2y+1} \), we need to identify the values of \( y \) for which the function is defined. The function is undefined when the denominator is zero because division by zero is not allowed.

Let's set the denominator equal to zero and solve for \( y \):
\[ 2y + 1 = 0 \]
Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 2y = -1 \]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[ y = -\frac{1}{2} \]

This tells us that the function \( k(y) \) is undefined at \( y = -\frac{1}{2} \). Therefore, the domain of \( k(y) \) is all real numbers except \( y = -\frac{1}{2} \).

In interval notation, this is written as:
\[ (-\infty, -\frac{1}{2}) \cup (-\frac{1}{2}, \infty) \]

So, the domain of the function is \(\boxed{(-\infty, -\frac{1}{2}) \cup (-\frac{1}{2}, \infty)}\).
