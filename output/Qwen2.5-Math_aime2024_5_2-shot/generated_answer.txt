To solve the problem, we start by noting that the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles and intersect at the origin. Let the coordinates of points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) be \((x_1, y_1)\), \((-x_1, -y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((-x_2, -y_2)\) respectively. Since these points lie on the hyperbola \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\), we have:
\[
\frac{x_1^2}{20} - \frac{y_1^2}{24} = 1 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{x_2^2}{20} - \frac{y_2^2}{24} = 1.
\]
The length of the diagonal \(BD\) is given by:
\[
BD = 2\sqrt{x_2^2 + y_2^2}.
\]
We need to find the maximum value of \(BD^2\), which is:
\[
BD^2 = 4(x_2^2 + y_2^2).
\]
Since \(A\) and \(B\) are symmetric with respect to the origin, the slope of \(AB\) is the same as the slope of \(CD\), and the slope of \(AC\) is the same as the slope of \(BD\). The slopes of the diagonals are perpendicular, so if the slope of \(AC\) is \(\frac{y_2}{x_2}\), then the slope of \(BD\) is \(-\frac{x_2}{y_2}\). The equation of the line \(AC\) is \(y = \frac{y_2}{x_2}x\), and the equation of the line \(BD\) is \(y = -\frac{x_2}{y_2}x\).

The points \(A\) and \(C\) are symmetric with respect to the origin, so if \(A = (x_1, y_1)\), then \(C = (-x_1, -y_1)\). The points \(B\) and \(D\) are also symmetric with respect to the origin, so if \(B = (x_2, y_2)\), then \(D = (-x_2, -y_2)\). The slopes of the lines \(AC\) and \(BD\) are perpendicular, so:
\[
\frac{y_2}{x_2} \cdot -\frac{x_2}{y_2} = -1.
\]
This confirms that the diagonals are perpendicular.

To find the maximum value of \(BD^2\), we use the fact that the points \(A\) and \(C\) lie on the hyperbola. Let \(x_1 = a\) and \(y_1 = b\). Then:
\[
\frac{a^2}{20} - \frac{b^2}{24} = 1.
\]
We need to express \(x_2^2 + y_2^2\) in terms of \(a\) and \(b\). Since \(A\) and \(C\) are symmetric with respect to the origin, the coordinates of \(B\) and \(D\) are such that the slopes of the diagonals are perpendicular. This implies that the coordinates of \(B\) and \(D\) are of the form \((x_2, y_2) = (b, -a)\) or \((-b, a)\). Therefore, we have:
\[
x_2^2 + y_2^2 = b^2 + a^2.
\]
Substituting \(b^2\) from the hyperbola equation, we get:
\[
b^2 = 24\left(1 + \frac{a^2}{20}\right) = 24 + \frac{3a^2}{5}.
\]
Thus,
\[
x_2^2 + y_2^2 = a^2 + 24 + \frac{3a^2}{5} = \frac{5a^2 + 3a^2 + 120}{5} = \frac{8a^2 + 120}{5} = \frac{8(a^2 + 15)}{5}.
\]
Therefore,
\[
BD^2 = 4\left(\frac{8(a^2 + 15)}{5}\right) = \frac{32(a^2 + 15)}{5}.
\]
To maximize \(BD^2\), we need to maximize \(a^2\). Since \(a^2\) can be any non-negative real number, the maximum value of \(a^2\) is unbounded. However, we need to find the greatest real number that is less than \(BD^2\) for all such rhombi. The minimum value of \(a^2\) is 0, so the minimum value of \(BD^2\) is:
\[
BD^2 = \frac{32(0 + 15)}{5} = \frac{480}{5} = 96.
\]
Therefore, the greatest real number that is less than \(BD^2\) for all such rhombi is:
\[
\boxed{96}.
