To find \( f^{-1}(f^{-1}(6)) \), we need to determine the value of \( f^{-1}(6) \) first, and then use that result to find \( f^{-1} \) of that value.

1. **Find \( f^{-1}(6) \):**
   - We know from the given information that \( f(2) = 6 \).
   - By definition of the inverse function, if \( f(a) = b \), then \( f^{-1}(b) = a \).
   - Therefore, \( f^{-1}(6) = 2 \).

2. **Find \( f^{-1}(f^{-1}(6)) \):**
   - We have already determined that \( f^{-1}(6) = 2 \).
   - Now, we need to find \( f^{-1}(2) \).
   - From the given information, we know that \( f(1) = 2 \).
   - By definition of the inverse function, if \( f(a) = b \), then \( f^{-1}(b) = a \).
   - Therefore, \( f^{-1}(2) = 1 \).

Thus, \( f^{-1}(f^{-1}(6)) = 1 \).

The final answer is \(\boxed{1}\).
