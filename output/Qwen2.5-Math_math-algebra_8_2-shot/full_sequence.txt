Question: Find all positive integer values of $c$ such that the equation $x^2-7x+c=0$ only has roots that are real and rational. Express them in decreasing order, separated by commas.
Full Solution: For the roots to be real and rational, the discriminant must be a perfect square. Therefore, $(-7)^2-4 \cdot 1 \cdot c = 49-4c$ must be a perfect square. The only positive perfect squares less than 49 are $1$, $4$, $9$, $16$, $25$, and $36$. The perfect squares that give a integer value of $c$ are $1$, $9$, and $25$. Thus, we have the equations $49-4c=1$, $49-4c=9$, and $49-4c=25$. Solving, we get that the positive integer values of c are $\boxed{12, 10, 6}$.

Question: Ten treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee. Two treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig. The combined weight of how many treeks equals the weight of one squig?
Full Solution: Let $t,s,g$ be the weight of one treek, the weight of one squig, and the weight of one goolee, respectively. Then the given information tells us \begin{align*}
10t &=3s+g\\
2t +g &= s.
\end{align*} Since we would like to solve for $s$ in terms of $t$, we want to eliminate $g$. Add the two equations to obtain \begin{align*}
10t+2t+g &= 3s+g+s\\
\Rightarrow 10t+2t &= 3s+s\\
\Rightarrow 4s &= 12t\\
\Rightarrow s &=3t.
\end{align*} So one squig weighs $\boxed{3}$ treeks.

Question: Suppose that $f$ is a function and $f^{-1}$ is the inverse of $f$.  If $f(1)=2$, $f(2) = 6$, and $f(3)=5$, then what is $f^{-1}(f^{-1}(6))$?

To find \( f^{-1}(f^{-1}(6)) \), we need to determine the value of \( f^{-1}(6) \) first, and then use that result to find \( f^{-1} \) of that value.

1. **Find \( f^{-1}(6) \):**
   - We know from the given information that \( f(2) = 6 \).
   - By definition of the inverse function, if \( f(a) = b \), then \( f^{-1}(b) = a \).
   - Therefore, \( f^{-1}(6) = 2 \).

2. **Find \( f^{-1}(f^{-1}(6)) \):**
   - We have already determined that \( f^{-1}(6) = 2 \).
   - Now, we need to find \( f^{-1}(2) \).
   - From the given information, we know that \( f(1) = 2 \).
   - By definition of the inverse function, if \( f(a) = b \), then \( f^{-1}(b) = a \).
   - Therefore, \( f^{-1}(2) = 1 \).

Thus, \( f^{-1}(f^{-1}(6)) = 1 \).

The final answer is \(\boxed{1}\).
