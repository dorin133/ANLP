To simplify the expression \((3-i)(6+2i)\), we use the distributive property, also known as the FOIL method (First, Outer, Inner, Last) for binomials. Here are the steps:

1. **First**: Multiply the first terms in each binomial.
   \[
   3 \cdot 6 = 18
   \]

2. **Outer**: Multiply the outer terms in the product.
   \[
   3 \cdot 2i = 6i
   \]

3. **Inner**: Multiply the inner terms in the product.
   \[
   -i \cdot 6 = -6i
   \]

4. **Last**: Multiply the last terms in each binomial.
   \[
   -i \cdot 2i = -2i^2
   \]

Next, we combine all these results:
\[
18 + 6i - 6i - 2i^2
\]

Notice that the \(6i\) and \(-6i\) terms cancel each other out:
\[
18 - 2i^2
\]

Recall that \(i^2 = -1\). Therefore, we substitute \(-1\) for \(i^2\):
\[
18 - 2(-1) = 18 + 2 = 20
\]

Thus, the simplified form of \((3-i)(6+2i)\) is:
\[
\boxed{20}
\]
