Question: The points $(x, y)$ represented in this table lie on a straight line. The point $(13, q)$ lies on the same line. What is the value of $p + q?$ Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth. $$\begin{array}{c|c}
x & y \\ \hline
2 & -5 \\
p & -14 \\
p+2 & -17 \\
\end{array}$$
Full Solution: If we have two points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ on a line, we can find the slope of the line by using the formula $\dfrac{y_1-y_2}{x_1-x_2}.$ So, for the line we are given, the slope is $\dfrac{(-5)-(-14)}{2-p}=\dfrac{9}{2-p},$ and the slope is also $\dfrac{(-14)-(-17)}{p-(p+2)}=\dfrac{3}{-2}.$ Setting these values equal, we get $$\dfrac{9}{2-p}=-\dfrac{3}{2}.$$ Multiplying both sides by the product of the denominators and simplifying gives \begin{align*}
(2-p)(3)&=(-2)(9)\\
6-3p&=-18 \\
p&=8.
\end{align*} Now we need to find $q.$ Using the same strategy as above, we find that \begin{align*}
\frac{q-(-5)}{13-2}&=\frac{3}{-2} \\
(11)(3)&=(-2)(q+5)\\
33&=-2q-10 \\
q&=-21.5.\\
\end{align*} Therefore, $p+q=8+(-21.5)=\boxed{-13.5}.$

Question: Mike paid $\$1.25$ for a stamp three years ago. He was just offered double that amount for the stamp. Assuming the stamp's offer price doubles every three years, how many dollars will he be offered in 12 more years?
Full Solution: The stamp is currently worth $\$2.50$. $12$ years is four more doubling periods, so at the end the stamp will be worth $2^4=16$ times what it is now, or

$$16(\$2.50)=\boxed{\$40}$$

To simplify the expression \((3-i)(6+2i)\), we use the distributive property, also known as the FOIL method (First, Outer, Inner, Last) for binomials. Here are the steps:

1. **First**: Multiply the first terms in each binomial.
   \[
   3 \cdot 6 = 18
   \]

2. **Outer**: Multiply the outer terms in the product.
   \[
   3 \cdot 2i = 6i
   \]

3. **Inner**: Multiply the inner terms in the product.
   \[
   -i \cdot 6 = -6i
   \]

4. **Last**: Multiply the last terms in each binomial.
   \[
   -i \cdot 2i = -2i^2
   \]

Next, we combine all these results:
\[
18 + 6i - 6i - 2i^2
\]

Notice that the \(6i\) and \(-6i\) terms cancel each other out:
\[
18 - 2i^2
\]

Recall that \(i^2 = -1\). Therefore, we substitute \(-1\) for \(i^2\):
\[
18 - 2(-1) = 18 + 2 = 20
\]

Thus, the simplified form of \((3-i)(6+2i)\) is:
\[
\boxed{20}
\]
