To find the remainder when \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})\) is divided by 1000, where \(\omega\) is a primitive 13th root of unity, we start by noting that \(\omega\) satisfies the equation \(\omega^{13} = 1\) and \(\omega^k \neq 1\) for \(1 \leq k \leq 12\). The polynomial whose roots are the 13th roots of unity is \(x^{13} - 1 = (x-1)(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1)\). Therefore, the polynomial \(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1\) has roots \(\omega, \omega^2, \ldots, \omega^{12}\).

We need to evaluate the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})\). Notice that \(\omega^{2k}\) is also a 13th root of unity, so we can rewrite the product as:
\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) = (2 - 2 \cdot 1 + 1^2) \prod_{k=1}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) = 1 \cdot \prod_{k=1}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) = \prod_{k=1}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}).
\]

Next, consider the polynomial \(P(x) = x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1\). We can express \(2 - 2x + x^2\) in terms of \(P(x)\) by noting that:
\[
x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1 = \frac{x^{13} - 1}{x - 1}.
\]
We need to find the value of the product \(\prod_{k=1}^{12} P(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})\). To do this, we consider the polynomial \(Q(x) = x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1\) evaluated at \(x = 2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}\). The polynomial \(Q(x)\) can be rewritten as:
\[
Q(x) = \frac{x^{13} - 1}{x - 1}.
\]
We need to find the value of \(Q(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})\) for \(k = 1, 2, \ldots, 12\). Notice that:
\[
(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})^{13} - 1 = 0,
\]
because \(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}\) is a root of the polynomial \(x^{13} - 1\). Therefore, we have:
\[
Q(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) = \frac{(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})^{13} - 1}{(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) - 1} = \frac{0}{(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) - 1} = 0.
\]
This means that \(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}\) is a root of the polynomial \(Q(x)\) for \(k = 1, 2, \ldots, 12\). Therefore, the product \(\prod_{k=1}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})\) is equal to the constant term of the polynomial \(Q(x)\) raised to the power of 12, which is 1. However, we need to consider the constant term of the polynomial \(Q(x)\) when evaluated at \(x = 2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}\).

To find the constant term, we use the fact that the sum of the roots of the polynomial \(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1\) is \(-1\). Therefore, the constant term of the polynomial \(Q(x)\) is 1. The product \(\prod_{k=1}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})\) is equal to the constant term of the polynomial \(Q(x)\) raised to the power of 12, which is 1. Therefore, the product is:
\[
\prod_{k=1}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) = 1.
\]

Finally, we need to find the remainder when \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) = 1 \cdot 1 = 1\) is divided by 1000. Therefore, the remainder is:
\[
\boxed{1}.
