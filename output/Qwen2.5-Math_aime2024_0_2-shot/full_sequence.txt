Let's think step by step. Each thought should be separated by exactly two newline characters r'\n\n'.
Question: Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be points on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.
Full Solution: Assume that $AC$ is the asymptote of the hyperbola, in which case $BD$ is minimized. The expression of $BD$ is $y=-\sqrt{\frac{5}{6}}x$. Thus, we could get $\frac{x^2}{20}-\frac{y^2}{24}=1\implies x^2=\frac{720}{11}$. The desired value is $4\cdot \frac{11}{6}x^2=480$. This case can't be achieved, so all $BD^2$ would be greater than $\boxed{480}$.

Question: Let ABCDEF be a convex equilateral hexagon in which all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Find the side length of the hexagon.
Full Solution: Draw an accurate diagram using the allowed compass and ruler: Draw a to-scale diagram of the $(200,240,300)$ triangle (e.g. 10cm-12cm-15cm). Because of the nature of these lengths and the integer answer needed, it can be assumed that the side length of the hexagon will be divisible by 10. Therefore, a trial-and-error method can be set up, wherein line segments of length $n\cdot 10$, scaled to the same scale as the triangle, can be drawn to represent the sides of the hexagon. For instance, side $BC$ would be drawn parallel to the side of the triangle of length 300, and would have endpoints on the other sides of the triangle. Using this method, it would be evident that line segments of length 80 units, scaled proportionally (4cm using the scale above), would create a perfect equilateral hexagon when drawn parallel to the sides of the triangle. $x=\boxed{080}$.

Question: Let $\omega \neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when 
\[ \prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) \] is divided by 1000.

To find the remainder when \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})\) is divided by 1000, where \(\omega\) is a primitive 13th root of unity, we start by noting that \(\omega\) satisfies the equation \(\omega^{13} = 1\) and \(\omega^k \neq 1\) for \(1 \leq k \leq 12\). The polynomial whose roots are the 13th roots of unity is \(x^{13} - 1 = (x-1)(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1)\). Therefore, the polynomial \(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1\) has roots \(\omega, \omega^2, \ldots, \omega^{12}\).

We need to evaluate the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})\). Notice that \(\omega^{2k}\) is also a 13th root of unity, so we can rewrite the product as:
\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) = (2 - 2 \cdot 1 + 1^2) \prod_{k=1}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) = 1 \cdot \prod_{k=1}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) = \prod_{k=1}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}).
\]

Next, consider the polynomial \(P(x) = x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1\). We can express \(2 - 2x + x^2\) in terms of \(P(x)\) by noting that:
\[
x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1 = \frac{x^{13} - 1}{x - 1}.
\]
We need to find the value of the product \(\prod_{k=1}^{12} P(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})\). To do this, we consider the polynomial \(Q(x) = x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1\) evaluated at \(x = 2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}\). The polynomial \(Q(x)\) can be rewritten as:
\[
Q(x) = \frac{x^{13} - 1}{x - 1}.
\]
We need to find the value of \(Q(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})\) for \(k = 1, 2, \ldots, 12\). Notice that:
\[
(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})^{13} - 1 = 0,
\]
because \(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}\) is a root of the polynomial \(x^{13} - 1\). Therefore, we have:
\[
Q(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) = \frac{(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})^{13} - 1}{(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) - 1} = \frac{0}{(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) - 1} = 0.
\]
This means that \(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}\) is a root of the polynomial \(Q(x)\) for \(k = 1, 2, \ldots, 12\). Therefore, the product \(\prod_{k=1}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})\) is equal to the constant term of the polynomial \(Q(x)\) raised to the power of 12, which is 1. However, we need to consider the constant term of the polynomial \(Q(x)\) when evaluated at \(x = 2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}\).

To find the constant term, we use the fact that the sum of the roots of the polynomial \(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1\) is \(-1\). Therefore, the constant term of the polynomial \(Q(x)\) is 1. The product \(\prod_{k=1}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})\) is equal to the constant term of the polynomial \(Q(x)\) raised to the power of 12, which is 1. Therefore, the product is:
\[
\prod_{k=1}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) = 1.
\]

Finally, we need to find the remainder when \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) = 1 \cdot 1 = 1\) is divided by 1000. Therefore, the remainder is:
\[
\boxed{1}.
