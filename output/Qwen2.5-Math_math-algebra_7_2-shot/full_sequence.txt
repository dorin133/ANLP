Question: Mike paid $\$1.25$ for a stamp three years ago. He was just offered double that amount for the stamp. Assuming the stamp's offer price doubles every three years, how many dollars will he be offered in 12 more years?
Full Solution: The stamp is currently worth $\$2.50$. $12$ years is four more doubling periods, so at the end the stamp will be worth $2^4=16$ times what it is now, or

$$16(\$2.50)=\boxed{\$40}$$

Question: Suppose that $f$ is a function and $f^{-1}$ is the inverse of $f$.  If $f(1)=2$, $f(2) = 6$, and $f(3)=5$, then what is $f^{-1}(f^{-1}(6))$?
Full Solution: Since $f(2) = 6$, we have $f^{-1}(6)=2$. (Note that the hypothesis that $f$ has an inverse implies that there are no other values of $x$ with $f(x) = 6$.)  Similarly, $f(1) =2$ implies $f^{-1}(2)=1$.   So $f^{-1}(f^{-1}(6))=f^{-1}(2)=\boxed{1}$.

To determine the positive integer values of \( c \) such that the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 7x + c = 0 \) has real and rational roots, we need to ensure that the discriminant of the quadratic equation is a perfect square. The general form of a quadratic equation is \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), and its discriminant is given by:

\[
\Delta = b^2 - 4ac
\]

For the given equation \( x^2 - 7x + c = 0 \), we have \( a = 1 \), \( b = -7 \), and \( c = c \). Substituting these values into the discriminant formula, we get:

\[
\Delta = (-7)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot c = 49 - 4c
\]

For the roots to be real and rational, the discriminant must be a non-negative perfect square. Therefore, we need:

\[
49 - 4c \geq 0
\]

Solving this inequality for \( c \):

\[
49 \geq 4c \implies c \leq \frac{49}{4} \implies c \leq 12.25
\]

Since \( c \) must be a positive integer, the possible values for \( c \) are \( 1, 2, 3, \ldots, 12 \). Next, we need to check which of these values make \( 49 - 4c \) a perfect square. We will test each value of \( c \):

- For \( c = 1 \): \( 49 - 4 \cdot 1 = 45 \) (not a perfect square)
- For \( c = 2 \): \( 49 - 4 \cdot 2 = 41 \) (not a perfect square)
- For \( c = 3 \): \( 49 - 4 \cdot 3 = 37 \) (not a perfect square)
- For \( c = 4 \): \( 49 - 4 \cdot 4 = 33 \) (not a perfect square)
- For \( c = 5 \): \( 49 - 4 \cdot 5 = 29 \) (not a perfect square)
- For \( c = 6 \): \( 49 - 4 \cdot 6 = 25 \) (perfect square, \( 25 = 5^2 \))
- For \( c = 7 \): \( 49 - 4 \cdot 7 = 21 \) (not a perfect square)
- For \( c = 8 \): \( 49 - 4 \cdot 8 = 17 \) (not a perfect square)
- For \( c = 9 \): \( 49 - 4 \cdot 9 = 13 \) (not a perfect square)
- For \( c = 10 \): \( 49 - 4 \cdot 10 = 9 \) (perfect square, \( 9 = 3^2 \))
- For \( c = 11 \): \( 49 - 4 \cdot 11 = 5 \) (not a perfect square)
- For \( c = 12 \): \( 49 - 4 \cdot 12 = 1 \) (perfect square, \( 1 = 1^2 \))

The values of \( c \) that make \( 49 - 4c \) a perfect square are \( 6, 10, \) and \( 12 \). Therefore, the positive integer values of \( c \) such that the equation \( x^2 - 7x + c = 0 \) has real and rational roots are:

\[
\boxed{12, 10, 6}
\]
