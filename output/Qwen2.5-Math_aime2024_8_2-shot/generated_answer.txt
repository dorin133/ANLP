To solve the problem, we need to determine the radii \( r_i \) and \( r_o \) of the circles along which the torus \( T \) is tangent to the sphere \( S \) when it rests on the inside and outside, respectively.

First, let's consider the torus \( T \). The torus is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis that is 6 units away from the center of the circle. The distance from the center of the torus to any point on the surface of the torus is given by \( R = 6 + 3 = 9 \) (the major radius) or \( R = 6 - 3 = 3 \) (the minor radius).

When the torus rests on the inside of the sphere \( S \), the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is \( 11 - r_i \). This distance is also equal to the major radius of the torus, which is 9. Therefore, we have:
\[
11 - r_i = 9 \implies r_i = 2
\]

Next, when the torus rests on the outside of the sphere \( S \), the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is \( 11 + r_o \). This distance is also equal to the major radius of the torus, which is 9. Therefore, we have:
\[
11 + r_o = 9 \implies r_o = -2
\]

However, this result is incorrect because \( r_o \) should be positive. Let's re-evaluate the problem by considering the correct distances.

When the torus rests on the outside of the sphere \( S \), the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is \( 11 + r_o \). This distance is also equal to the sum of the radius of the sphere and the radius of the circle along which the torus is tangent to the sphere. The radius of the circle along which the torus is tangent to the sphere is \( r_o \). Therefore, we have:
\[
11 + r_o = 11 + r_i + r_o = 11 + 3 + r_o = 14 + r_o
\]

This result is incorrect. re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re
