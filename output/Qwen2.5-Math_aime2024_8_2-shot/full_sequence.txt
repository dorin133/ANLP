Question: Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.

Full Solution: We have $\angle BCD = \angle CBD = \angle A$ from the tangency condition. With LoC we have $\cos(A) = \frac{25+100-81}{2*5*10} = \frac{11}{25}$ and $\cos(B) = \frac{81+25-100}{2*9*5} = \frac{1}{15}$. Then, $CD = \frac{\frac{9}{2}}{\cos(A)} = \frac{225}{22}$. Using LoC we can find $AD$: $AD^2 = AC^2 + CD^2 - 2(AC)(CD)\cos(A+C) = 10^2+(\frac{225}{22})^2 + 2(10)\frac{225}{22}\cos(B) = 100 + \frac{225^2}{22^2} + 2(10)\frac{225}{22}*\frac{1}{15} = \frac{5^4*13^2}{484}$. Thus, $AD = \frac{5^2*13}{22}$. By Power of a Point, $DP*AD = CD^2$ so $DP*\frac{5^2*13}{22} = (\frac{225}{22})^2$ which gives $DP = \frac{5^2*9^2}{13*22}$. Finally, we have $AP = AD - DP = \frac{5^2*13}{22} - \frac{5^2*9^2}{13*22} = \frac{100}{13}$. So the answer is $\boxed{113}$.

Question: Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]
Full Solution: We will denote $h(x)=4g(f(x))$ for simplicity. Denote $p(x)$ as the first equation and $q(y)$ as the graph of the second. We notice that both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ oscillate between 0 and 1. The intersections are thus all in the square $(0,0)$, $(0,1)$, $(1,1)$, and $(1,0)$. Every $p(x)$ wave going up and down crosses every $q(y)$ wave. Now, we need to find the number of times each wave touches 0 and 1.

We notice that $h(x)=0$ occurs at $x=-\frac{3}{4}, -\frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{3}{4}$, and $h(x)=1$ occurs at $x=-1, -\frac{1}{2}, 0,\frac{1}{2},1$. A sinusoid passes through each point twice during each period, but it only passes through the extrema once. $p(x)$ has 1 period between 0 and 1, giving 8 solutions for $p(x)=0$ and 9 solutions for $p(x)=1$, or 16 up and down waves. $q(y)$ has 1.5 periods, giving 12 solutions for $q(y)=0$ and 13 solutions for $q(y)=1$, or 24 up and down waves. This amounts to $16\cdot24=384$ intersections.

However, we have to be very careful when counting around $(1, 1)$. At this point, $q(y)$ has an infinite downwards slope and $p(x)$ is slanted, giving us an extra intersection; thus, we need to add 1 to our answer to get $\boxed{385}$.

Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the inside of $S$, it is internally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $	frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

To solve the problem, we need to determine the radii \( r_i \) and \( r_o \) of the circles along which the torus \( T \) is tangent to the sphere \( S \) when it rests on the inside and outside, respectively.

First, let's consider the torus \( T \). The torus is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis that is 6 units away from the center of the circle. The distance from the center of the torus to any point on the surface of the torus is given by \( R = 6 + 3 = 9 \) (the major radius) or \( R = 6 - 3 = 3 \) (the minor radius).

When the torus rests on the inside of the sphere \( S \), the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is \( 11 - r_i \). This distance is also equal to the major radius of the torus, which is 9. Therefore, we have:
\[
11 - r_i = 9 \implies r_i = 2
\]

Next, when the torus rests on the outside of the sphere \( S \), the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is \( 11 + r_o \). This distance is also equal to the major radius of the torus, which is 9. Therefore, we have:
\[
11 + r_o = 9 \implies r_o = -2
\]

However, this result is incorrect because \( r_o \) should be positive. Let's re-evaluate the problem by considering the correct distances.

When the torus rests on the outside of the sphere \( S \), the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is \( 11 + r_o \). This distance is also equal to the sum of the radius of the sphere and the radius of the circle along which the torus is tangent to the sphere. The radius of the circle along which the torus is tangent to the sphere is \( r_o \). Therefore, we have:
\[
11 + r_o = 11 + r_i + r_o = 11 + 3 + r_o = 14 + r_o
\]
