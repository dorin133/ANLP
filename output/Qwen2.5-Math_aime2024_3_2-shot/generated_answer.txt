To solve for \(AP\) in the given triangle \(ABC\) inscribed in circle \(\omega\), we start by using the properties of tangents and the power of a point theorem.

First, we note that \(D\) is the intersection of the tangents to \(\omega\) at \(B\) and \(C\). By the power of a point theorem, the power of point \(D\) with respect to \(\omega\) is equal to the square of the length of the tangent from \(D\) to \(\omega\). Let \(DB = DC = x\). Then, the power of point \(D\) is \(x^2\).

Since \(D\) is the intersection of the tangents at \(B\) and \(C\), \(D\) is the excenter of the triangle \(ABC\) opposite to \(A\). The length \(AD\) can be found using the formula for the length of the angle bisector in a triangle. However, a more straightforward approach is to use the fact that \(AD\) is the angle bisector of \(\angle BAC\) in the triangle formed by the tangents at \(B\) and \(C\) and the line segment \(BC\).

By the Angle Bisector Theorem, the ratio \(BP : PC = AB : AC = 5 : 10 = 1 : 2\). Therefore, \(P\) divides \(BC\) in the ratio \(1 : 2\).

Next, we use the formula for the length of the angle bisector in a triangle. The length of the angle bisector \(AD\) in \(\triangle ABC\) is given by:
\[
AD^2 = AB \cdot AC \left(1 - \frac{BC^2}{(AB + AC)^2}\right)
\]
Substituting the given values \(AB = 5\), \(BC = 9\), and \(AC = 10\), we get:
\[
AD^2 = 5 \cdot 10 \left(1 - \frac{9^2}{(5 + 10)^2}\right) = 50 \left(1 - \frac{81}{225}\right) = 50 \left(1 - \frac{9}{25}\right) = 50 \cdot \frac{16}{25} = 32
\]
Thus, \(AD = \sqrt{32} = 4\sqrt{2}\).

Now, we need to find the length \(AP\). Since \(P\) divides \(BC\) in the ratio \(1 : 2\), we can use the section formula to find the coordinates of \(P\). However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that \(P\) is the point where the angle bisector of \(\angle BAC\) intersects the circumcircle of \(\triangle ABC\).

By the Angle Bisector Theorem, the ratio \(AP : PD = AB : BD = AC : CD = 5 : 4\). Therefore, \(AP = \frac{5}{9} AD = \frac{5}{9} \cdot 4\sqrt{2} = \frac{20\sqrt{2}}{9}\).

Thus, \(AP\) can be written as \(\frac{m}{n}\) where \(m = 20\sqrt{2}\) and \(n = 9\). Since \(m\) and \(n\) are relatively prime integers, we have \(m = 20\sqrt{2}\) and \(n = 9\).

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{281}
\]
