Let's think step by step. Each thought should be separated by exactly two newline characters r'\n\n'.
Question: Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers $(a,b,c)$ satisfying $a + b + c = 300$ and \[a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.\]
Full Solution: $ab(a+b)+bc(b+c)+ac(a+c)=300(ab+bc+ac)-3abc=6000000, 100(ab+bc+ac)-abc=2000000$

Note that $(100-a)(100-b)(100-c)=1000000-10000(a+b+c)+100(ab+bc+ac)-abc=0$. Thus, $a/b/c=100$. There are $201$ cases for each but we need to subtract $2$ for $(100,100,100)$. The answer is $\boxed{601}$.

Question: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.
Full Solution: Let $w, x, y, z$ denote the number of residents who own 1, 2, 3, and 4 of these items, respectively. We know $w+x+y+z=900$, since there are 900 residents in total. This simplifies to $w+z=229$, since we know $x=437$ and $y=234$. Now, we set an equation for the total number of items. We know there are 195 rings, 367 clubs, 562 spades, and 900 candy hearts. Adding these up, there are 2024 items in total. Thus, $w+2x+3y+4z=2024$ since we are not adding the number of items each group of people contributes, and this must be equal to the total number of items. Plugging in $x$ and $y$, we get $w+4z=448$. Solving $w+z=229$ and $w+4z=448$, we get $z=73$.

Question: Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]

To find the number of intersections of the graphs of \( y = 4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) \), we need to analyze the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) and their compositions.

First, let's understand the behavior of \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \):
\[ f(x) = ||x| - \frac{1}{2}| \]
\[ g(x) = ||x| - \frac{1}{4}| \]

The function \( f(x) \) has a period of 1 and its graph is symmetric about \( x = 0 \). It takes the value 0 at \( x = \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and the value \(\frac{1}{2}\) at \( x = 0 \). The function \( g(x) \) also has a period of 1 and its graph is symmetric about \( x = 0 \). It takes the value 0 at \( x = \pm \frac{1}{4} \) and the value \(\frac{1}{4}\) at \( x = 0 \).

Now, let's consider the function \( y = 4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \). Since \( \sin (2 \pi x) \) has a period of 1, \( f(\sin (2 \pi x)) \) will also have a period of 1. The function \( f(\sin (2 \pi x)) \) will take values in the interval \([0, \frac{1}{2}]\) because \( \sin (2 \pi x) \) takes values in the interval \([-1, 1]\) and \( f(x) \) maps this interval to \([0, \frac{1}{2}]\). Therefore, \( g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \) will take values in the interval \([0, \frac{1}{4}]\), and \( y = 4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \) will take values in the interval \([0, 1]\).

Similarly, the function \( x = 4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) \) will also take values in the interval \([0, 1]\) because \( \cos (3 \pi y) \) takes values in the interval \([-1, 1]\) and \( f(x) \) maps this interval to \([0, \frac{1}{2}]\), and \( g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) \) will take values in the interval \([0, \frac{1}{4}]\), so \( x = 4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) \) will take values in the interval \([0, 1]\).

To find the number of intersections, we need to find the points \((x, y)\) such that \( y = 4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) \). Since both functions are periodic with period 1, we can consider the interval \([0, 1]\) for both \( x \) and \( y \).

 within the interval \([0, 1]\), the function \( \sin (2 \pi x) \) completes 2 full cycles, and the function \( \cos (3 \pi y) \) completes 3 full cycles. Therefore, there are 2 values of \( x \) for each value of \( y \) in the interval \([0, 1]\) where \( y = 4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \), and there are 3 values of \( y \) for each value of \( x \) in the interval \([0, 1]\) where \( x = 4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) \).

The number of intersections is the product of the number of times the function \( y = 4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \) completes a cycle and the number of times the function \( x = 4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) \) completes a cycle, which is \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \).

Therefore, the number of intersections of the graphs of \( y = 4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) \) is \(\boxed{6}\).
