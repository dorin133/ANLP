To find the number of intersections of the graphs of \( y = 4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) \), we need to analyze the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) and their compositions.

First, let's understand the behavior of \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \):
\[ f(x) = ||x| - \frac{1}{2}| \]
\[ g(x) = ||x| - \frac{1}{4}| \]

The function \( f(x) \) has a period of 1 and its graph is symmetric about \( x = 0 \). It takes the value 0 at \( x = \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and the value \(\frac{1}{2}\) at \( x = 0 \). The function \( g(x) \) also has a period of 1 and its graph is symmetric about \( x = 0 \). It takes the value 0 at \( x = \pm \frac{1}{4} \) and the value \(\frac{1}{4}\) at \( x = 0 \).

Now, let's consider the function \( y = 4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \). Since \( \sin (2 \pi x) \) has a period of 1, \( f(\sin (2 \pi x)) \) will also have a period of 1. The function \( f(\sin (2 \pi x)) \) will take values in the interval \([0, \frac{1}{2}]\) because \( \sin (2 \pi x) \) takes values in the interval \([-1, 1]\) and \( f(x) \) maps this interval to \([0, \frac{1}{2}]\). Therefore, \( g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \) will take values in the interval \([0, \frac{1}{4}]\), and \( y = 4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \) will take values in the interval \([0, 1]\).

Similarly, the function \( x = 4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) \) will also take values in the interval \([0, 1]\) because \( \cos (3 \pi y) \) takes values in the interval \([-1, 1]\) and \( f(x) \) maps this interval to \([0, \frac{1}{2}]\), and \( g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) \) will take values in the interval \([0, \frac{1}{4}]\), so \( x = 4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) \) will take values in the interval \([0, 1]\).

To find the number of intersections, we need to find the points \((x, y)\) such that \( y = 4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) \). Since both functions are periodic with period 1, we can consider the interval \([0, 1]\) for both \( x \) and \( y \).

 within the interval \([0, 1]\), the function \( \sin (2 \pi x) \) completes 2 full cycles, and the function \( \cos (3 \pi y) \) completes 3 full cycles. Therefore, there are 2 values of \( x \) for each value of \( y \) in the interval \([0, 1]\) where \( y = 4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \), and there are 3 values of \( y \) for each value of \( x \) in the interval \([0, 1]\) where \( x = 4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) \).

The number of intersections is the product of the number of times the function \( y = 4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \) completes a cycle and the number of times the function \( x = 4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) \) completes a cycle, which is \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \).

Therefore, the number of intersections of the graphs of \( y = 4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) \) is \(\boxed{6}\).
