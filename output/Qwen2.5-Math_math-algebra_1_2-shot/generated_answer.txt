To determine how many dollars Mike will be offered in 12 more years, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial Price**: Mike paid \$1.25 for the stamp three years ago.

2. **First Doubling**: The stamp's price doubles every three years. Therefore, in the next three years (which is three years from now), the price will be:
   \[
   1.25 \times 2 = 2.50
   \]

3. **Second Doubling**: After another three years (which is six years from now), the price will double again:
   \[
   2.50 \times 2 = 5.00
   \]

4. **Third Doubling**: After another three years (which is nine years from now), the price will double again:
   \[
   5.00 \times 2 = 10.00
   \]

5. **Fourth Doubling**: After another three years (which is twelve years from now), the price will double again:
   \[
   10.00 \times 2 = 20.00
   \]

Thus, in 12 more years, Mike will be offered \(\boxed{20}\) dollars.
