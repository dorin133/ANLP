To find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each rectangular box in the set \(\mathcal{B}\) with surface area 54 and volume 23, we start by letting the dimensions of the rectangular box be \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). The surface area and volume conditions give us the equations:
\[
2(ab + bc + ca) = 54 \quad \text{and} \quad abc = 23.
\]
We need to find the radius \(r\) of the smallest sphere that can contain the box, which is given by:
\[
r = \frac{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}}{2}.
\]
First, we express \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2\) in terms of \(ab + bc + ca\) and \(abc\). Using the identity:
\[
(a+b+c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca),
\]
we can solve for \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2\):
\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (a+b+c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca).
\]
From the surface area equation, we know:
\[
ab + bc + ca = 27.
\]
Thus,
\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (a+b+c)^2 - 54.
\]
To minimize \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2\), we need to find the minimum value of \(a+b+c\). By the AM-GM inequality, we have:
\[
a+b+c \geq 3\sqrt[3]{abc} = 3\sqrt[3]{23}.
\]
However, this does not necessarily give us the minimum value of \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2\) because \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) must also satisfy the surface area equation. Instead, we use the method of Lagrange multipliers or symmetry arguments to find the specific values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) that minimize \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2\).

Assume \(a = b\) and solve for \(c\). Then the equations become:
\[
2(a^2 + 2ac) = 54 \quad \text{and} \quad a^2c = 23.
\]
Simplifying the surface area equation, we get:
\[
2a^2 + 4ac = 54 \implies a^2 + 2ac = 27 \implies c = \frac{27 - a^2}{2a}.
\]
Substituting \(c\) into the volume equation, we get:
\[
a^2 \left(\frac{27 - a^2}{2a}\right) = 23 \implies \frac{a(27 - a^2)}{2} = 23 \implies a(27 - a^2) = 46 \implies a^3 - 27a + 46 = 0.
\]
We solve this cubic equation by trial and error. Testing \(a = 2\), we get:
\[
2^3 - 27 \cdot 2 + 46 = 8 - 54 + 46 = 0.
\]
So, \(a = 2\) is a root. Therefore, \(b = 2\) and \(c = \frac{27 - 2^2}{2 \cdot 2} = \frac{27 - 4}{4} = \frac{23}{4}\).

Now, we calculate \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2\):
\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 2^2 + 2^2 + \left(\frac{23}{4}\right)^2 = 4 + 4 + \frac{529}{16} = 8 + \frac{529}{16} = \frac{128}{16} + \frac{529}{16} = \frac{657}{16}.
\]
The radius \(r\) of the smallest sphere is:
\[
r = \frac{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{657}{16}}}{2} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{657}}{4}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{657}}{8}.
\]
Thus, \(r^2\) is:
\[
r^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{657}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{657}{64}.
\]
The value of \(p+q\) is:
\[
p + q = 657 + 64 = 721.
\]
Therefore, the answer is:
\[
\boxed{721}.
