Let's think step by step. Each thought should be separated by exactly two newline characters r'\n\n'.
Question: Find the largest possible real part of \[(75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z}\] where $z$ is a complex number with $|z|=4$.
Full Solution: We begin by simplifying the given expression in rectangular form. We are tasked with maximizing the real part of \[(75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z}\]. Let $z = a + bi$ where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers. Since $|z| = 4$, we have $a^2 + b^2 = 16$. The real part of the expression is found to be \[ \text{Re}(w) = 81a - 108b = 27(3a - 4b). \]
To maximize \text{Re}(w), we apply the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality. The vector $z = [a, b]$ is proportional to the vector $[3, -4]$, and the maximum occurs when $z$ is aligned with this vector. The unit vector that maximizes $v \cdot u$ is $u = v / |v|$, where $v = [3, -4].$

The magnitude of $v$ is $|v| = \sqrt{3^2 + (-4)^2} = 5$. Thus, we scale $z$ by $\frac{4}{5}$ to achieve the maximum real part. Combining this with the fact that $|z| = 4$, we compute the maximum real part as $27 \times 4 \times 5 = 540$.

Question: Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be points on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.
Full Solution: Assume that $AC$ is the asymptote of the hyperbola, in which case $BD$ is minimized. The expression of $BD$ is $y=-\sqrt{\frac{5}{6}}x$. Thus, we could get $\frac{x^2}{20}-\frac{y^2}{24}=1\implies x^2=\frac{720}{11}$. The desired value is $4\cdot \frac{11}{6}x^2=480$. This case can't be achieved, so all $BD^2$ would be greater than $\boxed{480}$.

Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\rac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.

To find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each rectangular box in the set \(\mathcal{B}\) with surface area 54 and volume 23, we start by letting the dimensions of the rectangular box be \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). The surface area and volume conditions give us the equations:
\[
2(ab + bc + ca) = 54 \quad \text{and} \quad abc = 23.
\]
We need to find the radius \(r\) of the smallest sphere that can contain the box, which is given by:
\[
r = \frac{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}}{2}.
\]
First, we express \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2\) in terms of \(ab + bc + ca\) and \(abc\). Using the identity:
\[
(a+b+c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca),
\]
we can solve for \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2\):
\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (a+b+c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca).
\]
From the surface area equation, we know:
\[
ab + bc + ca = 27.
\]
Thus,
\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (a+b+c)^2 - 54.
\]
To minimize \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2\), we need to find the minimum value of \(a+b+c\). By the AM-GM inequality, we have:
\[
a+b+c \geq 3\sqrt[3]{abc} = 3\sqrt[3]{23}.
\]
However, this does not necessarily give us the minimum value of \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2\) because \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) must also satisfy the surface area equation. Instead, we use the method of Lagrange multipliers or symmetry arguments to find the specific values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) that minimize \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2\).

Assume \(a = b\) and solve for \(c\). Then the equations become:
\[
2(a^2 + 2ac) = 54 \quad \text{and} \quad a^2c = 23.
\]
Simplifying the surface area equation, we get:
\[
2a^2 + 4ac = 54 \implies a^2 + 2ac = 27 \implies c = \frac{27 - a^2}{2a}.
\]
Substituting \(c\) into the volume equation, we get:
\[
a^2 \left(\frac{27 - a^2}{2a}\right) = 23 \implies \frac{a(27 - a^2)}{2} = 23 \implies a(27 - a^2) = 46 \implies a^3 - 27a + 46 = 0.
\]
We solve this cubic equation by trial and error. Testing \(a = 2\), we get:
\[
2^3 - 27 \cdot 2 + 46 = 8 - 54 + 46 = 0.
\]
So, \(a = 2\) is a root. Therefore, \(b = 2\) and \(c = \frac{27 - 2^2}{2 \cdot 2} = \frac{27 - 4}{4} = \frac{23}{4}\).

Now, we calculate \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2\):
\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 2^2 + 2^2 + \left(\frac{23}{4}\right)^2 = 4 + 4 + \frac{529}{16} = 8 + \frac{529}{16} = \frac{128}{16} + \frac{529}{16} = \frac{657}{16}.
\]
The radius \(r\) of the smallest sphere is:
\[
r = \frac{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{657}{16}}}{2} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{657}}{4}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{657}}{8}.
\]
Thus, \(r^2\) is:
\[
r^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{657}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{657}{64}.
\]
The value of \(p+q\) is:
\[
p + q = 657 + 64 = 721.
\]
Therefore, the answer is:
\[
\boxed{721}.
