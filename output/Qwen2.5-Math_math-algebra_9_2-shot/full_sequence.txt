Question: What is the domain of the function $$k(y) = \frac{1}{2y+1}~?$$ Express your answer in interval notation.
Full Solution: The fraction $\frac{1}{2y+1}$ fails to be defined only if the denominator is zero. This occurs when $y$ is the solution of the equation $$2y+1=0,$$ which is $y=-\frac 12$. Thus the domain of $k(y)$ is $$\boxed{\left(-\infty,-\frac 12\right)\cup \left(-\frac 12,\infty\right)}.$$

Question: Find all positive integer values of $c$ such that the equation $x^2-7x+c=0$ only has roots that are real and rational. Express them in decreasing order, separated by commas.
Full Solution: For the roots to be real and rational, the discriminant must be a perfect square. Therefore, $(-7)^2-4 \cdot 1 \cdot c = 49-4c$ must be a perfect square. The only positive perfect squares less than 49 are $1$, $4$, $9$, $16$, $25$, and $36$. The perfect squares that give a integer value of $c$ are $1$, $9$, and $25$. Thus, we have the equations $49-4c=1$, $49-4c=9$, and $49-4c=25$. Solving, we get that the positive integer values of c are $\boxed{12, 10, 6}$.

Question: The ratio of two numbers is $3:5$. When 4 is subtracted from the lesser of the two numbers and 8 is added to the larger of the two, the new ratio is $2:7$. What is the greater of the two numbers before 8 is added to it?
Full Solution:

Let the two numbers be \(3x\) and \(5x\), where \(3x\) is the lesser number and \(5x\) is the greater number. According to the problem, when 4 is subtracted from the lesser number and 8 is added to the greater number, the new ratio is \(2:7\). This can be expressed as:

\[
\frac{3x - 4}{5x + 8} = \frac{2}{7}
\]

To eliminate the fractions, we cross-multiply:

\[
7(3x - 4) = 2(5x + 8)
\]

Expanding both sides, we get:

\[
21x - 28 = 10x + 16
\]

Next, we isolate \(x\) by subtracting \(10x\) from both sides:

\[
11x - 28 = 16
\]

Then, we add 28 to both sides:

\[
11x = 44
\]

Finally, we solve for \(x\) by dividing both sides by 11:

\[
x = 4
\]

The greater of the two numbers before 8 is added to it is \(5x\). Substituting \(x = 4\) into \(5x\), we get:

\[
5x = 5 \cdot 4 = 20
\]

Thus, the greater of the two numbers before 8 is added to it is \(\boxed{20}\).
