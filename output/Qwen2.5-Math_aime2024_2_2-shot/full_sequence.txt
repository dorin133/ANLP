Let's think step by step. Each thought should be separated by exactly two newline characters r'\n\n'.
Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\rac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.
Full Solution: This question looks complex, but once converted into a number theory problem, it becomes elementary. We know, if the dimensions are taken to be numbers in the form of coprime numbers $p/q$, $q/r$, and $r$, it is immediately obvious that $p=23$. Solving, we get: \[23(r^2+q)/qr + q = 27\]. We know length cannot be negative, therefore, $q=4$. Again, we see: \[23/r + 4 + 23r/4 = 27\] giving rise to $r=2$. For a cuboid inside a circle, we know: the radius is half its diagonal, or equivalently, \[r^2 = (L^2 + b^2 + h^2)/4\]. Here, \[r^2 = (128 + 529)/64\], so we get $p+q = 657 + 64 = 721$.

Question: Let ABCDEF be a convex equilateral hexagon in which all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Find the side length of the hexagon.
Full Solution: Draw an accurate diagram using the allowed compass and ruler: Draw a to-scale diagram of the $(200,240,300)$ triangle (e.g. 10cm-12cm-15cm). Because of the nature of these lengths and the integer answer needed, it can be assumed that the side length of the hexagon will be divisible by 10. Therefore, a trial-and-error method can be set up, wherein line segments of length $n\cdot 10$, scaled to the same scale as the triangle, can be drawn to represent the sides of the hexagon. For instance, side $BC$ would be drawn parallel to the side of the triangle of length 300, and would have endpoints on the other sides of the triangle. Using this method, it would be evident that line segments of length 80 units, scaled proportionally (4cm using the scale above), would create a perfect equilateral hexagon when drawn parallel to the sides of the triangle. $x=\boxed{080}$.

Question: Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers $(a,b,c)$ satisfying $a + b + c = 300$ and \[a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.\]

To solve the problem, we start with the given equations:
\[a + b + c = 300\]
\[a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.\]

First, we factor the second equation:
\[a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = ab(a + b) + bc(b + c) + ca(c + a).\]

Using the identity \(a + b + c = 300\), we can substitute \(a + b = 300 - c\), \(b + c = 300 - a\), and \(c + a = 300 - b\) into the equation:
\[ab(300 - c) + bc(300 - a) + ca(300 - b) = 6,000,000.\]

Expanding the left-hand side, we get:
\[300ab - abc + 300bc - abc + 300ca - abc = 6,000,000,\]
\[300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.\]

Rearranging terms, we have:
\[300(ab + bc + ca) = 6,000,000 + 3abc,\]
\[ab + bc + ca = 20,000 + \frac{abc}{100}.\]

Since \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are nonnegative integers, \(\frac{abc}{100}\) must also be an integer. This implies that \(abc\) must be a multiple of 100. Let's consider the possible values for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).

First, we check if \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) can all be equal. If \(a = b = c\), then:
\[3a = 300 \implies a = 100.\]
Substituting \(a = b = c = 100\) into the second equation, we get:
\[100^2 \cdot 100 + 100^2 \cdot 100 + 100^2 \cdot 100 = 3 \cdot 100^3 = 3 \cdot 1000000 = 3000000 \neq 6000000.\]
So, \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) cannot all be equal.

Next, we check if two of the variables are equal and the third is different. Without loss of generality, let \(a = b\) and \(c = 300 - 2a\). Substituting these into the second equation, we get:
\[a^2a + a^2(300 - 2a) + a(300 - 2a)a + (300 - 2a)a^2 + (300 - 2a)a^2 + a^2(300 - 2a) = 6000000,\]
\[a^3 + a^2(300 - 2a) + a^2(300 - 2a) + a^2(300 - 2a) + a^2(300 - 2a) + a^2(300 - 2a) = 6000000,\]
\[a^3 + 4a^2(300 - 2a) + a^2(300 - 2a) = 6000000,\]
\[a^3 + 5a^2(300 - 2a) = 6000000,\]
\[a^3 + 1500a^2 - 10a^3 = 6000000,\]
\[-9a^3 + 1500a^2 = 6000000,\]
\[a^2(1500 - 9a) = 6000000,\]
\[a^2(500 - 3a) = 2000000.\]

We need to find integer solutions to this equation. By trial and error, we test possible values of \(a\):
- If \(a = 40\), then \(40^2(500 - 3 \cdot 40) = 1600 \cdot 320 = 512000 \neq 2000000\).
- If \(a = 50\), then \(50^2(500 - 3 \cdot 50) = 2500 \cdot 350 = 875000 \neq 2000000\).
- If \(a = 60\), then \(60^2(500 - 3 \cdot 60) = 3600 \cdot 260 = 936000 \neq 2000000\).
- If \(a = 80\), then \(80^2(500 - 3 \cdot 80) = 6400 \cdot 160 = 1024000 \neq 2000000\).
- If \(a = 100\), then \(100^2(500 - 3 \cdot 100) = 10000 \cdot 200 = 2000000\).

So, \(a = 100\), \(b = 100\), and \(c = 0\) is a solution. By symmetry, \((100, 0, 100)\) and \((0, 100, 100)\) are also solutions. Therefore, there are 3 solutions where two variables are equal and the third is zero.

Finally, we check if all three variables are different. By symmetry and the nature of the equation, there are no other integer solutions. Therefore, the total number of solutions is:
\[3.\]

The answer is:
\[\boxed{3}.\]
