Let's think step by step. Each thought should be separated by exactly two newline characters r'\n\n'.
Question: Let $\omega \neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when 
\[ \prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) \] is divided by 1000.
Full Solution: To find $\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})$, where $\omega \neq 1$ and $\omega^{13} = 1$, rewrite this as 
$(r - \omega)(s - \omega)(r - \omega^2)(s - \omega^2)...(r - \omega^{12})(s - \omega^{12})$ where $r$ and $s$ are the roots of the quadratic $x^2 - 2x + 2 = 0$. 
Grouping the $r$'s and $s$'s results in 
$\frac{r^{13} - 1}{r - 1} \cdot \frac{s^{13} - 1}{s - 1}$. 
The denominator $(r - 1)(s - 1) = 1$ by Vieta's formulas. 
The numerator $(rs)^{13} - (r^{13} + s^{13}) + 1 = 2^{13} - (-128) + 1 = 8321$ by Newton's sums. 
Thus, the final answer is $\boxed{321}$.

Question: Let ABCDEF be a convex equilateral hexagon in which all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Find the side length of the hexagon.
Full Solution: Draw an accurate diagram using the allowed compass and ruler: Draw a to-scale diagram of the $(200,240,300)$ triangle (e.g. 10cm-12cm-15cm). Because of the nature of these lengths and the integer answer needed, it can be assumed that the side length of the hexagon will be divisible by 10. Therefore, a trial-and-error method can be set up, wherein line segments of length $n\cdot 10$, scaled to the same scale as the triangle, can be drawn to represent the sides of the hexagon. For instance, side $BC$ would be drawn parallel to the side of the triangle of length 300, and would have endpoints on the other sides of the triangle. Using this method, it would be evident that line segments of length 80 units, scaled proportionally (4cm using the scale above), would create a perfect equilateral hexagon when drawn parallel to the sides of the triangle. $x=\boxed{080}$.

Question: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.

To solve the problem, we will use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let's define the following sets:
- \( D \) is the set of residents who own a diamond ring.
- \( G \) is the set of residents who own a set of golf clubs.
- \( S \) is the set of residents who own a garden spade.
- \( C \) is the set of residents who own a bag of candy hearts.

We are given the following information:
- \( |D| = 195 \)
- \( |G| = 367 \)
- \( |S| = 562 \)
- \( |C| = 900 \)
- The number of residents who own exactly two of these things is 437.
- The number of residents who own exactly three of these things is 234.

We need to find the number of residents who own all four of these things, denoted as \( |D \cap G \cap S \cap C| \).

First, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion for four sets:
\[
|D \cup G \cup S \cup C| = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| - |D \cap G| - |D \cap S| - |D \cap C| - |G \cap S| - |G \cap C| - |S \cap C| + |D \cap G \cap S| + |D \cap G \cap C| + |D \cap S \cap C| + |G \cap S \cap C| - |D \cap G \cap S \cap C|
\]

We know that the total number of residents is 900, so:
\[
|D \cup G \cup S \cup C| = 900
\]

Next, we need to express the sums of the intersections in terms of the given information. Let:
- \( x_2 \) be the number of residents who own exactly two of the items.
- \( x_3 \) be the number of residents who own exactly three of the items.
- \( x_4 \) be the number of residents who own all four of the items.

From the problem, we have:
\[
x_2 = 437
\]
\[
x_3 = 234
\]

We need to find \( x_4 \). To do this, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion again, but this time focusing on the intersections:
\[
|D \cap G| + |D \cap S| + |D \cap C| + |G \cap S| + |G \cap C| + |S \cap C| = \binom{2}{2}x_2 + \binom{3}{2}x_3 + \binom{4}{2}x_4
\]
\[
= x_2 + 3x_3 + 6x_4
\]

Substituting the known values:
\[
|D \cap G| + |D \cap S| + |D \cap C| + |G \cap S| + |G \cap C| + |S \cap C| = 437 + 3 \cdot 234 + 6x_4
\]
\[
= 437 + 702 + 6x_4
\]
\[
= 1139 + 6x_4
\]

Now, substitute this back into the inclusion-exclusion formula:
\[
900 = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 - (1139 + 6x_4) + 234 - x_4
\]

Simplify the right-hand side:
\[
900 = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 - 1139 - 6x_4 + 234 - x_4
\]
\[
900 = 1623 - 7x_4
\]

Solve for \( x_4 \):
\[
7x_4 = 1623 - 900
\]
\[
7x_4 = 723
\]
\[
x_4 = \frac{723}{7}
\]
\[
x_4 = 103
\]

Thus, the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things is:
\[
\boxed{103}
\]
