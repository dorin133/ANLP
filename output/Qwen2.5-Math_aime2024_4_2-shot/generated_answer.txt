To solve the problem, we will use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let's define the following sets:
- \( D \) is the set of residents who own a diamond ring.
- \( G \) is the set of residents who own a set of golf clubs.
- \( S \) is the set of residents who own a garden spade.
- \( C \) is the set of residents who own a bag of candy hearts.

We are given the following information:
- \( |D| = 195 \)
- \( |G| = 367 \)
- \( |S| = 562 \)
- \( |C| = 900 \)
- The number of residents who own exactly two of these things is 437.
- The number of residents who own exactly three of these things is 234.

We need to find the number of residents who own all four of these things, denoted as \( |D \cap G \cap S \cap C| \).

First, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion for four sets:
\[
|D \cup G \cup S \cup C| = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| - |D \cap G| - |D \cap S| - |D \cap C| - |G \cap S| - |G \cap C| - |S \cap C| + |D \cap G \cap S| + |D \cap G \cap C| + |D \cap S \cap C| + |G \cap S \cap C| - |D \cap G \cap S \cap C|
\]

We know that the total number of residents is 900, so:
\[
|D \cup G \cup S \cup C| = 900
\]

Next, we need to express the sums of the intersections in terms of the given information. Let:
- \( x_2 \) be the number of residents who own exactly two of the items.
- \( x_3 \) be the number of residents who own exactly three of the items.
- \( x_4 \) be the number of residents who own all four of the items.

From the problem, we have:
\[
x_2 = 437
\]
\[
x_3 = 234
\]

We need to find \( x_4 \). To do this, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion again, but this time focusing on the intersections:
\[
|D \cap G| + |D \cap S| + |D \cap C| + |G \cap S| + |G \cap C| + |S \cap C| = \binom{2}{2}x_2 + \binom{3}{2}x_3 + \binom{4}{2}x_4
\]
\[
= x_2 + 3x_3 + 6x_4
\]

Substituting the known values:
\[
|D \cap G| + |D \cap S| + |D \cap C| + |G \cap S| + |G \cap C| + |S \cap C| = 437 + 3 \cdot 234 + 6x_4
\]
\[
= 437 + 702 + 6x_4
\]
\[
= 1139 + 6x_4
\]

Now, substitute this back into the inclusion-exclusion formula:
\[
900 = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 - (1139 + 6x_4) + 234 - x_4
\]

Simplify the right-hand side:
\[
900 = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 - 1139 - 6x_4 + 234 - x_4
\]
\[
900 = 1623 - 7x_4
\]

Solve for \( x_4 \):
\[
7x_4 = 1623 - 900
\]
\[
7x_4 = 723
\]
\[
x_4 = \frac{723}{7}
\]
\[
x_4 = 103
\]

Thus, the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things is:
\[
\boxed{103}
\]
