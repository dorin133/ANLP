Question: Ten treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee. Two treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig. The combined weight of how many treeks equals the weight of one squig?
Full Solution: Let $t,s,g$ be the weight of one treek, the weight of one squig, and the weight of one goolee, respectively. Then the given information tells us \begin{align*}
10t &=3s+g\\
2t +g &= s.
\end{align*} Since we would like to solve for $s$ in terms of $t$, we want to eliminate $g$. Add the two equations to obtain \begin{align*}
10t+2t+g &= 3s+g+s\\
\Rightarrow 10t+2t &= 3s+s\\
\Rightarrow 4s &= 12t\\
\Rightarrow s &=3t.
\end{align*} So one squig weighs $\boxed{3}$ treeks.

Question: Simplify $(3-i)(6+2i)$.
Full Solution: $(3-i)(6+2i) = 3(6) + 3(2i) -i(6) -i(2i) = 18+6i-6i +2 = \boxed{20}$.

To determine the value of \( p + q \), we first need to find the equation of the straight line that passes through the given points. The general form of a linear equation is \( y = mx + b \), where \( m \) is the slope and \( b \) is the y-intercept.

First, we calculate the slope \( m \) using the points \((2, -5)\) and \((p+2, -17)\). The slope formula is:
\[
m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
\]
Substituting the coordinates of the points, we get:
\[
m = \frac{-17 - (-5)}{(p+2) - 2} = \frac{-17 + 5}{p} = \frac{-12}{p}
\]

Next, we use the point \((2, -5)\) to find the y-intercept \( b \). Substituting \( x = 2 \) and \( y = -5 \) into the equation \( y = mx + b \), we get:
\[
-5 = \frac{-12}{p} \cdot 2 + b
\]
\[
-5 = \frac{-24}{p} + b
\]
Solving for \( b \), we get:
\[
b = -5 + \frac{24}{p}
\]

Now we have the equation of the line:
\[
y = \frac{-12}{p}x - 5 + \frac{24}{p}
\]

We know that the point \((p, -14)\) lies on this line. Substituting \( x = p \) and \( y = -14 \) into the equation, we get:
\[
-14 = \frac{-12}{p} \cdot p - 5 + \frac{24}{p}
\]
\[
-14 = -12 - 5 + \frac{24}{p}
\]
\[
-14 = -17 + \frac{24}{p}
\]
Solving for \( p \), we get:
\[
-14 + 17 = \frac{24}{p}
\]
\[
3 = \frac{24}{p}
\]
\[
p = \frac{24}{3} = 8
\]

Now that we have \( p = 8 \), we substitute \( p = 8 \) back into the equation of the line to find \( q \). The point \((13, q)\) lies on the line, so we substitute \( x = 13 \) into the equation:
\[
y = \frac{-12}{8}x - 5 + \frac{24}{8}
\]
\[
y = -\frac{3}{2}x - 5 + 3
\]
\[
y = -\frac{3}{2}x - 2
\]
Substituting \( x = 13 \), we get:
\[
q = -\frac{3}{2} \cdot 13 - 2
\]
\[
q = -\frac{39}{2} - 2
\]
\[
q = -\frac{39}{2} - \frac{4}{2}
\]
\[
q = -\frac{43}{2} = -21.5
\]

Finally, we find \( p + q \):
\[
p + q = 8 + (-21.5) = 8 - 21.5 = -13.5
\]

Thus, the value of \( p + q \) is \(\boxed{-13.5}\).
